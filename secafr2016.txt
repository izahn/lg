  as of September 30, 2016, an increase of $242
  million or six percent from FY 2015.

  For the assets received resulting from enforcement
  judgments, the SEC recognizes a corresponding
  liability, which is either custodial if the collections
  are transferred to the U.S. Treasury General Fund
  or the Investor Protection Fund, or governmental
  if the collections are held pending distribution to
  harmed investors.

  The increase of $61 million in Liability for
  Disgorgement and Penalties is due to an increase in
  penalties recorded between October 1, 2015 and
  September 30, 2016.

  This increase in Liability for Disgorgement and            Table 1.3 | Liabilities as of September 30, 2016

SEC’s operations and are now deposited to the
U.S. Treasury General Fund upon collection.

Reserve Fund. Section 991(e) of the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) authorized the creation
of a Securities and Exchange Commission Reserve
Fund (Reserve Fund). Funded from filing fee
collections, the SEC can deposit up to $50 million
per fiscal year, and the fund cannot hold more than
$100 million in total. Excess filing fees are depos-
ited to the U.S. Treasury General Fund.

For the year ended September 30, 2016, filing fee
revenues totaled $489 million. Fifty million dollars
was deposited into the Reserve Fund, of which
$5 million was sequestered. The remainder of
$439 million was earned on behalf of the U.S.
Treasury General Fund.

   Description: The SEC staff responds to requests for guidance from individuals and market participants about specific provisions
   of the federal securities laws. These queries may seek interpretations of the securities laws or regulations, or assurances that
   no enforcement action will be taken if the individual or market participant engages in a specified activity. The staff also reviews
   applications for exemptions from the securities laws. Written responses to such requests for guidance, when provided, generally
   are publicly available, as are applications and related notices and orders, when issued. This metric gauges the timeliness of initial
   comments issued by the Divisions of Trading and Markets, Investment Management, and Corporation Finance.

Annual Assurance Statement

Assurance Statement on Internal Control Over Operations: The SEC management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal controls that meet
the objectives of the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (FMFIA). In
accordance with OMB Circular A-123, Management’s Responsibility for Enterprise
Risk Management and Internal Control, the SEC conducted its annual assessment of
the effectiveness of internal controls. Based on the results of the assessment for the
period ending September 30, 2016, the SEC is able to provide reasonable assurance
that the internal controls for the agency meet the objectives of the FMFIA. No
material weaknesses were found in the design or operation of the internal controls for
the Fiscal Year ended September 30, 2016.

Assurance Statement on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (ICFR): In accor-
dance with OMB Circular A-123 Appendix A, Internal Control Over Reporting, the
SEC conducted its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, which includes safeguarding of assets and compliance with applicable laws
and regulations. Based on the results of the assessment, the SEC is able to provide
reasonable assurance that internal controls over financial reporting, both for the
agency as a whole and for the Investor Protection Fund, met the objectives of FMFIA
and were operating effectively as of September 30, 2016. No material weaknesses
were found in the design or operation of controls.

SEC also conducted reviews of its financial management systems in accordance with
OMB Circular A-123 Appendix D, Compliance with the Federal Financial Manage-
ment Improvement Act. Based on the results of these reviews, SEC can provide
reasonable assurance that its financial management systems substantially comply with
the requirements of the FFMIA as of September 30, 2016.

62 | 2016 SEC AGENCY FINANCIAL REPORT
Report on the Financial Statements and on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002 requires that SEC annually prepare and submit
audited financial statements to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget.5 The
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended in 2010 by section 922 of the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), requires SEC to annually submit
a complete set of audited financial statements for IPF to Congress.6 IPF’s financial transactions
are also included in SEC’s overall financial statements. In accordance with the authority
conferred by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, as amended by the Government
Management Reform Act of 1994,7 we have audited the SEC and IPF financial statements.
Further, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, we have assessed the effectiveness of SEC’s
internal control over financial reporting, evaluated SEC’s assessment of such effectiveness, and
are attesting to and reporting on SEC’s assessment of its internal control over financial
reporting. SEC’s financial statements comprise the balance sheets as of September 30, 2016,
and 2015; the related statements of net cost of operations, changes in net position, budgetary
resources, and custodial activity for the fiscal years then ended; and the related notes to the
financial statements. IPF’s financial statements comprise the balance sheets as of
September 30, 2016, and 2015; the related statements of net cost of operations, changes in net
position, and budgetary resources for the fiscal years then ended; and the related notes to the
financial statements. We also have audited SEC’s internal control over financial reporting as of
September 30, 2016, based on criteria established under 31 U.S.C. § 3512(c), (d), commonly
known as the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA).

We conducted our audits in accordance with U.S. generally accepted government auditing
standards. We believe that the audit evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our audit opinions.

Management’s Responsibility

SEC management is responsible for (1) the preparation and fair presentation of SEC’s financial
statements and those of IPF in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles;
(2) preparing, measuring, and presenting the RSI in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles; (3) preparing and presenting other information included in documents
containing the audited financial statements and auditor’s report, and ensuring the consistency of
that information with the audited financial statements and the RSI; (4) maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting, including the design, implementation, and maintenance
of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; (5) evaluating the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established under
FMFIA; and (6) providing its assertion about the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting as of September 30, 2016, based on its evaluation, included in the Management
Assurance section of the agency financial report.

                                                                                                        FINANCIAL SECTION | 63
           Auditor’s Responsibility

           Our responsibility is to express opinions on SEC’s and IPF’s financial statements and opinions
           on internal control over financial reporting for SEC and for IPF, based on our audits. U.S.
           generally accepted government auditing standards require that we plan and perform the audits
           to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material
           misstatement, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
           all material respects. We are also responsible for applying certain limited procedures to the RSI
           and other information included with the financial statements.

           An audit of financial statements involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about
           the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on
           the auditor’s judgment, including the auditor’s assessment of the risks of material misstatement
           of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the
           auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the
           financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
           circumstances. An audit of financial statements also involves evaluating the appropriateness of
           the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made
           by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. An
           audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal
           control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, evaluating
           the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the
           assessed risk, and testing relevant internal control over financial reporting. Our audit of internal
           control also considered the entity’s process for evaluating and reporting on internal control over
           financial reporting based on criteria established under FMFIA. Our audits also included
           performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

           We did not evaluate all internal controls relevant to operating objectives as broadly established
           under FMFIA, such as those controls relevant to preparing performance information and
           ensuring efficient operations. We limited our internal control testing to testing controls over
           financial reporting. Our internal control testing was for the purpose of expressing an opinion on
           whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained, in all material
           respects. Consequently, our audit may not identify all deficiencies in internal control over
           financial reporting that are less severe than a material weakness.8

           Definitions and Inherent Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

           An entity’s internal control over financial reporting is a process effected by those charged with
           governance, management, and other personnel, the objectives of which are to provide
           reasonable assurance that (1) transactions are properly recorded, processed, and summarized
           to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted

            A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such
           that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be
           prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or
           operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned
           functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis.

and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent, or
detect and correct, misstatements due to fraud or error. We also caution that projecting any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion on SEC’s Financial Statements

In our opinion, SEC’s financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, SEC’s financial
position as of September 30, 2016, and 2015, and its net cost of operations, changes in net
position, budgetary resources, and custodial activity for the fiscal years then ended in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Opinion on IPF’s Financial Statements

In our opinion, IPF’s financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, IPF’s financial
position as of September 30, 2016, and 2015, and its net cost of operations, changes in net
position, and budgetary resources for the fiscal years then ended in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

In our opinion, SEC maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of September 30, 2016, for SEC and for IPF, based on criteria established under
FMFIA. Our opinions on SEC’s internal control are consistent with SEC’s assertion that its
internal control over financial reporting, both for the agency as a whole and for IPF, were
operating effectively as of September 30, 2016, and that no material weaknesses were found in
the design or operation of the controls.

During our 2016 audit, we identified deficiencies in SEC’s internal control over financial
reporting that we do not consider to be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies.9
Nonetheless, these deficiencies warrant SEC management’s attention. We have communicated
these matters to SEC management and, where appropriate, will report on them separately.

Other Matters

    Required Supplementary Information

U.S. generally accepted accounting principles issued by the Federal Accounting Standards
Advisory Board (FASAB) require that required supplementary information (RSI) be presented to
supplement the financial statements. Although not a part of the financial statements, FASAB
considers this information to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the financial
statements in appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain
limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted government auditing standards, which consisted of inquiries of management about the
methods of preparing the RSI and comparing the information for consistency with


9
 A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a
material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.




                                                                                                               FINANCIAL SECTION | 65
           management’s responses to the auditor’s inquiries, the financial statements, and other
           knowledge we obtained during the audit of the financial statements, in order to report omissions
           or material departures from FASAB guidelines, if any, identified by these limited procedures. We
           did not audit and we do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the RSI because
           the limited procedures we applied do not provide sufficient evidence to express an opinion or
           provide any assurance.

               Other Information

           SEC’s other information contains a wide range of information, some of which is not directly
           related to the financial statements. This information is presented for purposes of additional
           analysis and is not a required part of the financial statements or RSI. We read the other
           information included with the financial statements in order to identify material inconsistencies, if
           any, with the audited financial statements. Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming
           an opinion on SEC’s and IPF’s financial statements. We did not audit and do not express an
           opinion or provide any assurance on the other information.

           Report on Compliance with Laws, Regulations, Contracts, and Grant Agreements

           In connection with our audits of SEC’s and IPF’s financial statements, we tested compliance
           with selected provisions of applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements
           consistent with our auditor’s responsibility discussed below. We caution that noncompliance
           may occur and not be detected by these tests. We performed our tests of compliance in
           accordance with U.S. generally accepted government auditing standards.

           Management’s Responsibility

           SEC management is responsible for complying with laws, regulations, contracts, and grant
           agreements applicable to SEC and IPF.

           Auditor’s Responsibility

           Our responsibility is to test compliance with selected provisions of laws, regulations, contracts,
           and grant agreements applicable to SEC and IPF that have a direct effect on the determination
           of material amounts and disclosures in the SEC and IPF financial statements, and to perform
           certain other limited procedures. Accordingly, we did not test compliance with all laws,
           regulations, contracts, and grant agreements applicable to SEC and IPF.

           Results of Our Tests for Compliance with Laws, Regulations, Contracts, and Grant Agreements

           Our tests for compliance with selected provisions of applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and
           grant agreements disclosed no instances of noncompliance for fiscal year 2016 that would be
           reportable under U.S. generally accepted government auditing standards. However, the
           objective of our tests was not to provide an opinion on compliance with laws, regulations,
           contracts, and grant agreements applicable to SEC and IPF. Accordingly, we do not express
           such an opinion.

           Intended Purpose of Report on Compliance with Laws, Regulations, Contracts, and Grant
           Agreements

           The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of compliance with
           selected provisions of applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, and the




66 | 2016 SEC AGENCY FINANCIAL REPORT
results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on compliance. This report is an integral
part of an audit performed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted government auditing
standards in considering compliance. Accordingly, this report on compliance with laws,
regulations, contracts, and grant agreements is not suitable for any other purpose.

Agency Comments

In commenting on a draft of this report, SEC expressed pleasure that GAO found that SEC’s
financial statements and notes were presented fairly, in all material respects, and in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. SEC stated that it will continue to build upon
this strong audit result by modernizing the technology platforms supporting key areas of its
finances. SEC added that these initiatives will help the agency reduce manual processes and
improve data quality and reporting. SEC also stated that it will continue to formalize its
enterprise risk management program in response to updated guidance from GAO and the Office
of Management and Budget. The complete text of SEC’s response is reprinted in enclosure I.

                                                  November 10, 2016

              Mr. James R. Dalkin
              Director
              Financial Management and Assurance
              United States Government Accountability Office
              441 G Street, NW
              Washington, DC 20548

              Dear Mr. Dalkin:

                       Thank you for the opportunity to review and comment on the audit report of the
              Government Accountability Office (GAO). I am pleased that the GAO’s FY 2016 audit found
              that the SEC’s financial statements and notes were presented fairly, in all material respects, and
              in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

                      In the coming year, the SEC will continue to build upon this strong audit result by
              modernizing the technology platforms supporting key areas of our finances. The agency is
              making significant progress on the Edgar Fee System Modernization (EFSM), which will
              support the SEC’s management of registration fees once the new platform is deployed in FY
              2017. In FY 2017, the SEC will begin building a disgorgement and penalties system (DPS) to
              improve both financial and programmatic reporting of enforcement actions. Finally, the SEC
              will work to replace the SEC’s legacy system for budget formulation and add capabilities for
              tracking the agency’s strategic performance metrics. Together, these initiatives will help the
              agency reduce manual processes and improve data quality and reporting. The SEC also will
              continue to formalize its enterprise risk management program in response to updated guidance
              from GAO and the Office of Management and Budget.

                      I very much appreciate the professional manner in which you and your team conducted
              the audit for FY 2016. I look forward to continuing our productive dialogue in the coming
              months on the SEC’s efforts to address the areas noted in your report. If you have any questions,
              please feel free to contact me.

                                                                          Sincerely,

         TO:           Mary Jo White, Chair

         FROM:         Carl W. Hoecker, Inspector General

         SUBJECT:      The Inspector General’s Statement on the SEC’s Management and Performance
                       Challenges, October 2016

         The Reports Consolidation Act of 2000 requires the U.S. Securities and Exchange
         Commission (SEC or agency) Office of Inspector General (OIG) to identify and report annually
         on the most serious management challenges that the SEC faces. In deciding whether to
         identify an issue as a challenge, we consider its significance in relation to the SEC’s mission;
          its susceptibility to fraud, waste, and abuse; and the SEC’s progress in addressing the
         challenge. We compiled this statement on the basis of our past and ongoing audit, evaluation,
         investigation, and review work; our knowledge of the SEC’s programs and operations; and
         information from SEC management and staff, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office
         (GAO) auditors who conduct the SEC’s annual financial statement audit. We previously provided
         a draft of this statement to SEC officials and considered all comments received when finalizing
         the statement. As we begin fiscal year (FY) 2017, we identified the following areas where the
         SEC faces management and performance challenges to varying degrees:
               •   Meeting Expanded Regulatory Oversight Responsibilities
               •   Ensuring an Effective Information Security Program
               •   Improving Contract Management
               •   Ensuring Effective Human Capital Management

         In prior years, we reported that Financial Management also posed a management and
         performance challenge for the agency due primarily to significant deficiencies and other
         financial reporting internal control weaknesses identified during GAO’s annual financial
         statement audit. We are pleased to remove Financial Management from this year’s statement. In
         GAO’s audits of the 2014 and 2015 financial statements of the SEC and the Investor Protection
         Fund, GAO found (1) the SEC’s and the Investor Protection Fund’s financial statements for the
         FYs ended September 30, 2014, and September 30, 2015, were presented fairly, in all material
         respects, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
         principles; (2) the SEC maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
         financial reporting for the SEC and Investor Protection Fund as of September 30, 2015;

(3) no reportable noncompliance for FY 2015 with provisions of applicable laws, regulations,
contracts, and grant agreements tested; and (4) during FY 2015, the SEC made progress in
addressing internal control deficiencies GAO had reported in FY 2014, specifically in the
agency’s accounting for disgorgement and penalty transactions, such that GAO no longer
considers the remaining control deficiencies in this area to represent a significant deficiency as
of September 30, 2015.1

Each of the remaining challenges and corresponding audit, evaluation, investigation, or review
work is discussed in the attachment. If you have any questions, please contact Rebecca L.
Sharek, Deputy Inspector General for Audits, Evaluations, and Special Projects.

          Attachment. THE INSPECTOR GENERAL’S STATEMENT ON THE SEC’S 		
          MANAGEMENT AND PERFORMANCE CHALLENGES, OCTOBER 2016

          CHALLENGE: Meeting Expanded Regulatory Oversight Responsibilities

          Budgetary Resources. As we have previously reported, the increase in the SEC’s responsibilities
          in recent years continues to present challenges for the agency as it carries out
          its mission to protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate
          capital formation. The SEC has reported record numbers of enforcement actions and orders
          directing the payment of penalties and disgorgement, an increase in the number of
          examinations performed, and progress in rulemakings and initiatives to use data, analytics,
          and risk-based approaches to further the agency’s mission. However, throughout 2016, the
          SEC Chair provided congressional testimony, similar to testimony provided in 2015, identifying a
          lack of sufficient resources as a continuing challenge. Specifically, in her June 14, 2016, testimony
          before the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban
          Affairs, the SEC Chair stated the following:

                      While the Commission today is stronger and more effective than ever before,
                      challenges remain if we are to continue our current trajectory and address the
                      growing size and complexity of the securities markets. We now oversee
                      approximately 28,000 market participants and selectively review the disclosures
                      and financial statements of over 9,000 reporting companies. From 2001 to 2015,
                      assets under management of SEC-registered advisers more than tripled from
                      approximately $21.5 trillion to approximately $66.8 trillion, and assets under
                      management of mutual funds more than doubled from $7 trillion to over
                      $15 trillion. Trading volume in the equity markets from 2001 through 2015 nearly
                      tripled to over $70 trillion. And, as this Committee knows, the SEC’s
                      responsibilities have also significantly increased, with new or expanded
                      responsibilities for security-based derivatives, hedge fund and other private fund
                      advisers, credit rating agencies, municipal advisors, clearing agencies, and
                      crowdfunding portals. As I have testified before both the House and Senate, the
                      SEC is significantly under-resourced for the extensive responsibilities it has, even
                      though our budget is deficit neutral and funded by very modest transaction fees.2

          In 2014 and 2015, we reported that the SEC (specifically, the SEC Chair and the agency’s
          Investor Advocate) had identified resource constraints and an immediate and pressing need
          for ensuring sufficient examination coverage of registered investment advisers (IAs) as a

              before the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. The Chair provided similar
              testimony and before the United States House of Representatives Subcommittee on Financial Services and
              General Government, Committee on Appropriations on March 22, 2016, and before the United States Senate
              Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government, Committee on Appropriations on April 12, 2016.
              Senior Officers from the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, Office of Compliance Inspections and
              Examinations, Office of Credit Ratings, and Office of the Whistleblower also provided similar testimony before the
              United States House of Representatives Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored
              Enterprises, Committee on Financial Services on April 21, 2016.

challenge and a “substantial and continuing risk to investors.”3 The SEC must continue to find
ways to use its limited resources to keep pace with changes in the size and complexity of the
securities markets and the market participants the SEC oversees and regulates, absent
additional funding increases.

To assess the agency’s progress in this area, in FY 2015, we initiated an evaluation of the
Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations’ (OCIE) efficiency and effectiveness in
managing its human resources to address mission priorities and long-term goals, particularly
for IA examinations. In our report titled Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations’
Management of Investment Adviser Examination Coverage Goals, Report No. 533, issued
March 10, 2016, we reported that OCIE has worked to increase its examination coverage of
IAs, including creating an Office of Risk Analysis and Surveillance and enhancing its use of
advanced quantitative techniques, and continues to seek new ways to increase its efficiency.
However, we found that improvements were needed to assess OCIE’s progress toward
meeting strategic objectives and long-term IA examination coverage goals. Specifically, we
found that: (1) OCIE’s performance measure—percentage of IAs examined each year—may
not provide meaningful information because of variations in examination types, examination
candidates, and regional office processes; and (2) the IA/Investment Company program may
benefit from adopting the GAO risk management framework.

Furthermore, we found that OCIE’s management of IA examination goals and performance
metrics can be more consistent with Federal internal control and risk management standards.
Greater consistency will help ensure that examinations conducted support OCIE’s examination
priorities, as well as OCIE’s long-term goal and the SEC’s strategic plan. In addition, we
reported that management should ensure that OCIE’s performance metrics allow management
 to assess performance and ensure efficient and effective use of OCIE’s limited resources
across regional offices. In September 2015, OCIE hired a consultant to help identify ways
OCIE can more efficiently use its resources. In addition, we made two specific
recommendations for corrective action. As of the date of this memorandum, management had
not received the consultant’s results, and both our recommendations for corrective action
remained open.

We also reviewed relevant policies and procedures and the Division of Enforcement’s
(Enforcement) internal coordination of investigations after a Federal court suggested that such
an examination was warranted to ensure that (1) Enforcement investigations with overlapping
factual circumstances are properly coordinated, and (2) scarce agency resources are deployed
efficiently. In a management letter titled Final Management Letter: Evaluation of the SEC
Division of Enforcement’s Coordination Related to a Federal Civil Action, issued June 30,
2016, we reported that the SEC has processes and systems for coordinating Enforcement
investigations internally and, when appropriate, across agency divisions and offices. However,
we found that staff judgment, which is central to the SEC’s processes for coordinating
investigations, led to an instance of untimely information-sharing. We made three
recommendations designed to further strengthen the SEC’s policies and procedures for
coordinating investigations and making efficient use of limited resources. Management

          concurred with our recommendations and has taken action sufficient to close one of the
          recommendations. As of the date of this memorandum, the other two recommendations
          remained open.

          Technology Enhancements. The SEC continues to recognize the need for “harnessing
          technology to better identify risks, uncover frauds, sift through large volumes of data, inform
          policymaking, and streamline operations”4 as a way to achieve its expanding regulatory
          responsibilities and keep pace with the markets and market participants. According to the
          Chair’s testimony, the emphasis on technological improvements continues to pay dividends,
          improving efficiencies while allowing the agency to cover more ground than ever before. Key
          information technology (IT) initiatives included the following:
                  •   expanding data analytics tools;
                  •   improving enforcement investigation and litigation tracking;
                  •   redesigning the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) system;
                  •   improving examinations through risk assessment and surveillance tools;
                  •   investing in further business process automation and improvements; and
                  •   enhancing the Tips, Complaints, and Referrals (TCR) system.

          We continue to focus our efforts on assessing the agency’s progress in enhancing its
          technology. For example, in 2015, we identified various factors that led to schedule delays
          and cost increases in the agency’s project to elicit requirements, design, and deploy the
          redesigned TCR system, which was originally scheduled to “go-live” in July 2014. At the time
          we issued our management letter on the subject (Final Management Letter: Observations
          Noted During TCR System Audit Support Engagement, issued May 20, 2015), the SEC had
          not accepted the redesigned TCR system and a final user acceptance date had not been
          established, resulting in uncertainty in the timeframe for implementing the redesigned TCR
          system. As of the date of this memorandum, agency management expected the redesigned
          TCR system to “go live” in January 2017, 2.5 years later than planned.

          In addition, during FY 2016, we assessed the SEC’s IT requirements-gathering process, which
          impacts the agency’s IT investments, including those to modernize the agency’s systems and
          improve the efficiency of the SEC’s programs. Because the majority of the agency’s IT
          investments involve contracting, we discuss the results of our work in this area under the
          challenge titled “Improving Contract Management.”

          For FY 2017, we are planning additional work to assess how well the SEC achieves its
          expanding regulatory oversight responsibilities by: reviewing the agency’s approaches for improving
          examination programs, including examinations intended to strengthen the

technology infrastructure of the U.S. securities markets; ensuring investor access to material
information; and modernizing its IT infrastructure, including EDGAR, to improve efficiencies
and increase the effectiveness of its programs.

CHALLENGE: Ensuring an Effective Information Security Program

The SEC generates and collects commercially valuable, market-sensitive, proprietary, and
other nonpublic information. To accomplish the SEC’s mission, the agency shares sensitive
information internally among its divisions and offices and externally with the regulated
community and financial regulators. In April 2016, the Chair testified that the ability to monitor
and avoid advanced persistent threats was a top priority and that the SEC’s IT security
program planned to focus its efforts on improved risk management and monitoring.5

In addition, during her keynote address at the Security Traders Association 83rd Annual Market
Structure Conference, the Chair discussed the importance of the consolidated audit trail (CAT)
and the challenges of ensuring the security of CAT data. The CAT will be a comprehensive
audit trail that will allow regulators to more efficiently and accurately track activity in national
market system securities throughout the U.S. markets. The CAT is being created by a joint
plan of the 18 national securities exchanges and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority,
pursuant to SEC Rule 613. Although the CAT Plan Processor (and not the SEC) is
responsible for developing, managing, and monitoring the CAT, the SEC is responsible for
ensuring the security of CAT data that may be accessed by agency employees and/or stored
on the agency’s network to support regulatory activities. In her address, the Chair stated:

                  There is no higher market structure priority for me than to ensure Commission
                  consideration of a final CAT plan before the end of the year. One of the major
                  issues raised in comments has been the need for robust controls to protect
                  sensitive personal information and proprietary data from cybersecurity threats.
                  I share this priority, especially given the breadth of data that will be collected by
                  the CAT. The Commission is carefully assessing the security requirements of
                  the CAT plan and evaluating comments on optimal approaches to address data
                  security concerns. The Commission, of course, must ensure that it has strong
                  measures in place to protect the sensitive, non-public information it handles, and
                  I am strongly committed to implementing such measures in conducting our
                  regulatory oversight responsibilities using CAT data.6

The SEC has made progress in some areas of information security. For example, to comply
with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12, in summer 2016 the SEC began requiring
employees and contractors at certain locations to use their Personal Identify Verification (PIV)
cards for network access. The agency anticipates mandatory usage of PIV cards by all
employees and contractors by November 2016. In addition, the SEC’s Office of Information

          Technology (OIT) addressed many recommendations from prior audits and evaluations, as
          discussed further below. However, we continue to identify and assess weaknesses in the
          agency’s information security controls.

          For example, we completed our FY 2015 audit of the effectiveness of the SEC’s information
          security and privacy programs and whether OIT has policies, procedures, and practices
          consistent with Federal Information Security Modernization Act requirements (Audit of the
          SEC’s Compliance with the Federal Information Security Modernization Act for Fiscal Year
          2015, Report No. 535, issued June 2, 2016). Overall, we found that OIT improved in key
          information security program areas, including implementing PIV to the maximum extent
          practicable, establishing multi-factor authentication for external systems, and improving identity
          and access management.

          However, we determined that (1) OIT’s risk management program did not effectively monitor
          risks associated with system authorizations, and (2) OIT’s configuration management program
          did not ensure that system owners adhered to baseline configuration requirements. In
          addition, as in FYs 2013 and 2014, we found that OIT had not fully addressed some areas of
          potential risk identified in prior Federal Information Security Management Act evaluations.
          Specifically, SEC systems continued to operate without current authorizations, user accounts
          were not always deactivated in accordance with policy, continuous monitoring review
          procedures were developed but not consistently implemented, and some policies and
          procedures remained outdated or inconsistent.

          In addition, we identified three other matters of interest related to the agency’s information
          technology environment. Specifically, we determined that the SEC did not always (1) update
          Business Impact Analyses to reflect major system changes, (2) update contingency planning
          documents to reflect changes in alternate site locations, or (3) track security awareness
          training. We made four recommendations that address support for risk-based decisions, OIT
          Risk Committee functionality, and configuration management requirements. Management
          concurred with these recommendations and has already taken action on two of them. As of
          the date of this memorandum, two recommendations from the FY 2015 audit remained open,
          as did one recommendation from the FY 2014 evaluation. However, management had
          sufficiently addressed all recommendations from the FY 2013 evaluation.

          In addition, during FY 2016, management sufficiently addressed two recommendations we
          made in FY 2015 to review data security controls and complete required security assessments
          and privacy impact assessments of third party fund administrators used to distribute
          disgorgement and penalty amounts collected to harmed investors.7

          In our report titled Audit of the SEC’s Process for Reviewing Self-Regulatory Organizations’
          Proposed Rule Changes, Report No. 537, issued September 23, 2016, we reported that
          information security controls for the system used to submit and track self-regulatory
          organizations’ proposed rule changes needed improvement. We made four recommendations
          to improve the system’s information security and contingency planning documents.
          Management concurred with the recommendations, which will be closed upon completion and
          verification of corrective action.

In FY 2016, we completed two investigations related to information security. In one matter, we
discovered that an employee sent nonpublic information to a personal e-mail account on
26 occasions and to the employee’s spouse’s e-mail account on 2 occasions. In the other
matter, an SEC attorney transmitted nonpublic information from a personal non-secure e-mail
account to the attorney’s official SEC e-mail account. The OIG reported the results of these
investigations to SEC management to determine whether corrective administrative actions may
be warranted.

Finally, as part of its audit of the SEC’s FYs 2014 and 2015 financial statements, GAO
reported in April 20168 that the SEC improved its information security by addressing
weaknesses GAO had previously identified. However, according to GAO, weaknesses
continue to limit the effectiveness of other security controls. In particular, GAO found that the
SEC did not consistently protect access to its systems; did not consistently manage the
configuration of its systems; did not always appropriately separate incompatible duties; and did
not ensure that contingency and disaster recovery plans for its information systems were fully
reviewed, completed, or up-to-date. According to GAO, these weaknesses existed in part
because the SEC had not fully implemented an organization-wide information security
program, as called for by Federal law and guidance. In particular, the agency had not
(1) consistently reviewed and updated its information security policies in a timely manner,
(2) completely documented plans of action to address weaknesses, (3) documented a physical
inventory of its systems and applications, and (4) fully implemented a program to continuously
monitor the security of its systems and networks. In addition to 15 prior recommendations that
had not been fully implemented as of the date of GAO’s report, GAO recommended that the
SEC take 6 additional actions to more fully implement its information security program. In a
separate report with limited distribution, GAO recommended that the SEC take 30 actions to
address newly identified control weaknesses. SEC management concurred with GAO’s
recommendations. According to agency management, OIT has implemented corrective
actions to address GAO’s recommendations.

The OIG has established a working group consisting of OIG auditors, special agents, and IT
specialists, and we will leverage the expertise of this working group to assist us in continuing to
assess the SEC’s information security program.

CHALLENGE: Improving Contract Management

According to the agency’s 2015 Agency Financial Report (AFR), the Office of Acquisitions
(OA) continues to enhance the planning, award, and administration of contracts by focusing on
long-term scalable enterprise contracts, increasing collaboration and early involvement in
planning SEC procurements, and leveraging SEC buying to obtain better business deals and
pricing with longer term contracts.9 We have observed efforts to consolidate contracts
(specifically, for Oracle-related investments) to achieve efficiencies. In addition, OA reported
returning nearly $31 million to SEC budgets in FY 2015 through its de-obligation and closeout
process, and estimates returning more than $40 million for FY 2016. Also, OA reported
surpassing all small business goals set for the agency in FY 2015 and anticipates that it will

          meet or exceed its FY 2016 goals. Although OA continues to improve its processes, we
          continue to identify areas of needed improvements in other offices’ and divisions’ contract
          management.

          For example, as previously discussed, there have been repeated delays and contract
          extensions related to the agency’s effort to elicit requirements, design, and deploy the
          redesigned TCR system. Various factors, including unacceptable contractor performance and
          a lack of adequate contractor and Government resources to timely address concerns, led to
          the project’s schedule delays and cost increases. As we reported last year, in February 2015, GAO
          included “Improving the Management of Information Technology (IT) Acquisitions and Operations”
          as a new high-risk area needing attention by Congress and the executive
          branch.10 Specifically, GAO stated:

                         Congress has passed legislation and the administration has undertaken
                         numerous initiatives to better manage IT investments. Nonetheless, federal IT
                         investments too frequently fail to be completed or incur cost overruns and
                         schedule slippages while contributing little to mission-related outcomes. GAO
                         has found that the federal government spent billions of dollars on failed and
                         poorly performing IT investments which often suffered from ineffective
                         management, such as project planning, requirements definition, and program
                         oversight and governance.

          As a result, we initiated an audit to assess the SEC’s IT requirements-gathering process. We
          determined that, between October 1, 2013, and November 25, 2015, the SEC obligated more
          than $521 million for 692 IT investments. The SEC has engaged contractors to manage many
          of these IT investments. In our report titled Audit of the SEC’s Information Technology
          Requirements-Gathering Process, Report No. 538, issued September 30, 2016, we found that
          the SEC initiated efforts in September 2015 to establish an IT Requirements Center of
          Excellence. By August 2016, OIT had rolled-out the Requirements Center of Excellence
          framework. However, OIT has not fully designed and implemented the SEC’s IT requirements-
          gathering process, and opportunities exist to improve OIT’s oversight of the SEC’s IT
          investments and their underlying requirements. Specifically, we reviewed a sample of
          17 development, modernization, and enhancement (DME) investments and 8 steady state
          investments and found that OIT did not consistently document or validate detailed, measurable
          requirements, particularly for DME investments. In addition, OIT did not always ensure that
          investments were managed by integrated project teams and certified individuals, where
          necessary, or define project team members’ roles and responsibilities for IT requirements-
          gathering. We also found that investment documents did not always demonstrate that OIT
          integrated security requirements into DME investment planning and initiation phases.

          Furthermore, OIT did not consistently review and coordinate IT investments—particularly
          steady state investments, investments to acquire technology equipment, and Oracle support
          services investments—to prevent redundancy; and for two investments, governance
          authorities did not review and approve changes to the investments’ baselines before
          implementation. As a result, (1) OIT did not always comply with Federal regulations, Federal
          and industry guidelines it recognizes in its own policies and procedures, and its own policies

and procedures; (2) two contractor–managed IT investments we reviewed were delayed
between 6 and 15 months from their initial completion dates (one of them incurred about
$1.9 million in additional costs to further define requirements and continue project development
and implementation); and (3) the SEC may not realize any cost savings from an effort to
consolidate some contracts for Oracle support services.

Additionally, the SEC may not have optimized its technology equipment purchases. We also question
$24,230 paid to a contractor hired to gather requirements during a period when the corresponding
project had no specific requirements-gathering activity. Finally, we determined
that the SEC paid one contractor about $1 million to develop requirements that, according to
the business sponsor, may in part need to be re-worked once a dependency (a separate
system component) is completed, and paid another contractor about $600,000 for a project
that was put on hold. We made seven recommendations for corrective action. Management
concurred with the recommendations, which will be closed upon completion and verification of
corrective action.

Also, in FY 2016, OA improved the SEC’s Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR)
Program by sufficiently addressing all six recommendations from an OIG audit completed in
2015.11 However, we identified additional concerns with the performance of COR duties for
one contract. In our report titled Management of the SEC’s Protective Security Force Contract Needs
Improvement (Report No. 536, issued June 22, 2016), we found that the Office of
Security Services (OSS) did not ensure that the contractor responsible for providing Special
Police Officers (SPO) to perform guard duties at the SEC’s Headquarters met all contract
terms and Federal best practices. Specifically, the COR allowed the contractor to deviate from
contract terms about SPO training and testing and Federal best practices, and relied instead
on the less stringent SPO licensing requirements of the District of Columbia Metropolitan
Police Department. The SEC also paid for SPO training that the contractor did not provide.
Based on information provided by OA and OSS, the difference in contractually required versus
actual training hours resulted in questioned costs of about $177,000.

Moreover, we found that OSS did not ensure the contractor met all contract terms relating to
contract deliverables, quality control practices, and weapons inventories. For example, the contractor
did not provide some required periodic reports, including reports about SPO training
and weapons, and maintained incomplete and inaccurate firearms information, including
inaccurate firearm serial numbers. The COR did not have an accurate list of all firearms on-
site for almost a year. As a result, the SEC did not ensure that the contractor performed
adequate quality inspections or provided accurate information for proper contract oversight.

Furthermore, we found that post orders, which define the specific duties that SPOs are to
perform at certain locations throughout the SEC’s Headquarters, needed improvement.
Although most of the information in the post orders appeared sufficient and appropriate for
SPOs to understand their duties, some information was inconsistent among all post orders,
post orders for one post conflicted with the contract, and post orders for another post were
incomplete. This could result in inconsistent or improper performance of SPO duties or
responses to emergencies. To improve the SEC’s oversight of its protective security force
contract, we made four recommendations. The recommendations address improvements to

          ensure contractor compliance with contract terms and communication between OA and OSS.
          Management concurred with the recommendations, which will be closed upon completion and
          verification of corrective action.

          Based on (1) observations from our prior work, (2) GAO’s recognition of IT acquisition as a
          high-risk area across the executive branch, and (3) the magnitude and criticality of the SEC’s
          ongoing and planned IT modernization efforts, we plan to perform work in FY 2017 to assess
          the SEC’s continued progress in improving its contract management broadly and its IT
          acquisitions specifically. To assist in this effort, the OIG established an internal acquisition
          task force in FY 2016 to analyze and track information related to the SEC’s acquisition
          activities.

          CHALLENGE: Ensuring Effective Human Capital Management

          The SEC seeks to hire and retain a skilled and diverse workforce and to ensure that all
          decisions affecting employees and applicants are fair and ethical. Attracting, engaging, and
          retaining a technically proficient and diverse workforce is one of the agency’s stated strategic
          objectives.12 To that end, we noted that the SEC has sufficiently addressed all
          recommendations from a 2014 OIG audit of the agency’s representation of minorities and
          women in its workforce.13 Also in 2016, based on the results of its Federal Employee
          Viewpoint Survey, the SEC was ranked 3 out of the 37 large agencies on the Office of
          Personnel Management’s Global Satisfaction Index rankings. In addition, according to the agency’s
          2015 AFR, the SEC established a new Expert Inventory/Skills Database, known as
          Talent Profile, to “identify specialized staff experience and expertise that might not be applied
          during an employee’s regular day-to-day activities, but which is needed when unusual but
          important situations arise,” and a new Career Horizons program that “further helps employees
          advance their careers through a systematic skills and training acquisition strategy.” The 2015
          AFR also discusses the launch of the Aspiring Leaders Program to promote and build
          leadership competencies of senior employees.

          During 2016, the Office of Human Resources (OHR) released a Human Capital Strategic Plan
          to align the agency’s human capital with the achievement of its mission, goals, and objectives. The
          agency also released an SEC Strategic Workforce Plan, which “provides an overview of
          the current workforce; identifies critical workforce competencies for SEC mission critical
          occupations; and identifies perceived workforce competency gaps from
          supervisors/managers.” Based on the competency gaps identified from supervisors and managers,
          the Plan established the following three primary goals:


                    •   Goal 1: Reduce gaps in core/professional competencies across mission-critical
                        occupations.
                    •   Goal 2: Reduce gaps in technical competencies across mission-critical occupations.
                    •   Goal 3: Increase leadership-ready talent pools across all SK grade levels.

The Plan also outlines strategies to begin addressing the competency gaps and includes tasks
that should be initiated or completed in the next 2 years. However, as we stated in FY 2015,
human capital management remains a challenge.

In its 2015 AFR, the SEC stated that, in FY 2016, OHR would continue to streamline the hiring
process, allowing OHR to recruit staff quickly and efficiently in response to the demands of the
mission. On November 30, 2015, we announced an audit to determine whether the SEC’s
hiring process facilitated the efficient selection of high-quality candidates. Because OHR had
not fully implemented systems to reliably monitor the timeliness and quality of agency hiring,
and because OHR planned to reassess the SEC’s hiring process and predetermined hiring
timelines, we terminated the audit. In our resulting management letter, we reported
observations based on the work completed (Final Closeout Memorandum: Audit of the SEC’s
Hiring Practices, issued August 19, 2016). We found that in the last few years, OHR has
improved the SEC’s hiring process by, among other things, developing a Service Level
Commitment that established the service levels (that is, hiring timelines), monitoring methods,
and organizational responsibilities for the SEC’s hiring process; developing quality-of-new-hire
surveys; and implementing the Workforce Transformation Tracking System to monitor agency
hiring from end to end.

However, we identified opportunities for further improvements. Specifically, we determined
that OHR did not have an effective method for assessing the timeliness of the SEC’s hiring
process, including maintaining reliable hiring data and monitoring hiring actions according to
timelines established in the Service Level Commitment. Furthermore, OHR did not analyze
quality-of-new-hire survey results to improve the SEC’s hiring process. As part of OHR’s
reassessment of the agency’s hiring process, we urged OHR to implement an effective system
based on reliable data to conduct comprehensive assessments of the SEC’s hiring process.
Doing so could further improve the hiring process and increase the likelihood that SEC
divisions and offices timely hire highly qualified candidates to meet mission requirements.

In addition, in March 2016, we reported that the SEC is one of the Federal agencies that
consistently uses student loan repayments the most to recruit or retain highly qualified
personnel (Audit of the SEC’s Student Loan Repayment Program, Report No. 534, issued
March 31, 2016). In 2014 and 2015, OHR implemented significant changes to the SEC’s
Student Loan Repayment Program (SLRP). However, we identified internal controls
weaknesses impacting the SLRP Program Office’s ability to effectively manage the program.
Specifically, Program Office personnel did not (1) maintain complete and accurate participant
information, (2) implement or enforce effective approval and verification controls, or (3) update
the SEC’s SLRP policy and ensure the policy complied with certain Federal requirements. A
prior OIG audit, an Office of Personnel Management evaluation, and an internal OHR
assessment identified similar issues. As a result, we were not able to determine whether the
SEC always complied with statutory annual and lifetime SLRP limits ($10,000 and $60,000,
respectively).

Furthermore, although we verified that the SEC either collected or was collecting repayments
from 95 former employees, Program Office personnel were unaware of 17 other individuals
who had left the SEC and Federal service between January 2007 and June 2015 before
fulfilling their service agreements. These 17 individuals owed the SEC a total of about
$216,000. In addition, SLRP Program Office personnel did not always implement or enforce effective
approval and verification controls. To improve the SEC’s management of its SLRP,




                                                                                   OTHER INFORMATION | 135

          Page 13


          thereby improving its likelihood of retaining highly qualified personnel, we made nine
          recommendations for corrective action. Management concurred with the recommendations,
          and has already taken action to close one that led to recouping the funds owed by individuals
          who left the agency before fulfilling their service agreements. As of the date of this
          memorandum, the other eight recommendations remained open.

          In FY 2017, we will continue to monitor the SEC’s human capital management, including its
          progress toward (1) addressing competency gaps identified by supervisors and managers, and
          (2) meeting the goals established in the agency’s new Human Capital Strategic Plan.

  THE CHAIR
                                        November 2, 2016

Mr. Carl W. Hoecker
Inspector General
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
Washington, D.C. 20549

Dear Mr. Hoecker:

         Thank you for your “Statement on the SEC’s Management and Performance Challenges,”
issued on October 7, 2016. We remain committed to enhancing the programmatic and
operational effectiveness of the SEC and appreciate the Office of Inspector General’s role in the
effort. Below is an overview of the actions—taken and planned to be taken—to address each of the
challenges identified in your statement.

Regulatory Oversight

        Management continues to address the regulatory challenges faced in the areas of budget
and technology in order to successfully meet the SEC’s mission.

Budgetary Resources

        We agree the SEC continues to need additional resources in order to keep pace with
securities markets that have been growing rapidly in size and complexity. While the SEC has
made significant strides forward in recent years in strengthening our operations and programs,
challenges remain in our efforts to fulfill our broad mandates and responsibilities.

         The SEC is charged with overseeing 26,000 market participants, including investment
advisers, mutual funds and exchange traded funds, broker-dealers, transfer agents, clearing
agencies, national securities exchanges, credit rating agencies, and clearing agencies. In recent
years, those responsibilities have dramatically increased with new or expanded jurisdiction over
securities-based derivatives, hedge fund and other private fund advisers, credit rating agencies,
municipal advisors, and clearing agencies, as well as a requirement to implement and oversee a
new regime for crowdfunding offerings, among other changes. As the size and complexity of the
entities in the SEC’s jurisdiction grows, the agency’s need for additional resources becomes even
more acute.

        The President’s Budget Request for the SEC in FY 2017 seeks additional resources for
several key priorities, including increasing examination coverage of investment advisers,
leveraging cutting-edge technology, strengthening the SEC’s enforcement program, bolstering the
SEC’s economic and risk analysis functions, and hiring highly skilled experts.




                                                                                   OTHER INFORMATION | 137
           Mr. Carl Hoecker
           Page 2

                   The Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations’ leadership is actively working
           on both of the OIG’s recommendations set forth in Report No. 533 entitled “Office of
           Compliance Inspections and Examinations’ Management of Investment Adviser Examination
           Coverage Goals.” With respect to Recommendation 1, the engagement with the consultant
           conducting the “efficiency study” has been extended to November 18, 2016. OCIE leadership
           expects to receive the study on or before this date and will share the study with the OIG soon
           thereafter. OCIE’s Exam Process Steering Committee provided OCIE leadership an overview of
           its recommendations to improve investment adviser/investment company (IA/IC) program
           planning. OCIE leadership will review the recommendations of the consultant and its Exam
           Process Steering Committee once both are complete. With respect to Recommendation 2, OCIE
           is continuing to consider the GAO risk management framework and how it may implement
           additional aspects of the framework within its IA/IC program. Furthermore, OCIE leadership
           has taken steps to use its limited resources to increase its examination coverage of investment
           advisers by reallocating examiners to its IA/IC program.

                    Your statement references the OIG’s letter report titled “Final Management Letter:
           Evaluation of the SEC Division of Enforcement’s Coordination Related to a Federal Civil
           Action” issued on June 30, 2016. As the letter notes, the SEC has strong processes and systems
           to facilitate coordination across related matters, and earlier information sharing in the matter
           reviewed would not have changed the theory of liability or the remedies sought in that matter.
           Over the past five fiscal years, Enforcement has made numerous improvements to its case
           tracking systems to increase the Division’s ability to timely share information across related
           inquiries and investigations. Management will continue to consider and review processes and
           systems to ensure that information is shared appropriately across related matters.

           Technology Enhancements

                    The TCR 3.0 modernization project experienced improvement in FY 2016. The
           contractor has remediated the majority of code defects we identified in 2015 UAT and has added
           a new and effective “search” function. To enhance project oversight, the Division of
           Enforcement detailed an Assistant Director with significant TCR experience to DERA to identify
           and address substantive issues within the system. A full UAT was conducted in August that
           identified a limited number of remaining defects, which are in the process of being remediated,
           and created an opportunity to include minor change requests during the remediation window.
           The UAT also identified a platform performance issue, which is in the process of being
           remediated. A final UAT to confirm platform performance, defect correction, and change
           request effectiveness is scheduled in November 2016 which, if successful, will enable TCR 3.0
           to go live in January 2017.

           Information Security

                    The Office of Information Technology has made tremendous strides in addressing audit
           recommendations to enhance the SEC’s Information Security Program. OIT continues to
           prioritize providing timely support for all of our audit partners, including OIG’s Offices of Audit
           and Investigations and the Government Accountability Office. In fiscal year 2016, OIT
           submitted materials demonstrating successful corrective action for all 66 open audit
           recommendations. To date, GAO and OIG have closed 35 recommendations and are currently




138 | 2016 SEC AGENCY FINANCIAL REPORT

reviewing previously provided corrective actions to address the remaining recommendations. In
addition to supporting and remediating OIG and GAO audit recommendations related to the
SEC’s implementation of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014, OIT
provided support for eight ad-hoc requests from OIG’s Office of Audits, and over 30 ad-hoc
requests from OIG’s Office of Investigations. OIT also provided timely support for the OIG’s
Cybersecurity Act of 2015 review, and two additional information security-related audits while
managing its obligations to support many other important agency initiatives and regulatory
priorities.

         In addition to OIT’s significant efforts meeting with and providing materials and
expertise to the OIG and the GAO, OIT made significant progress towards enhancing the
Commission’s operational security capabilities. Specifically, in support of its Information
Security Continuous Monitoring Program, OIT deployed an integrated information security
compliance management capability to serve as a centralized repository for the management of
the Commission’s FISMA compliance obligations, information system Plans of Action and
Milestones, incident tracking, and continuous monitoring efforts. OIT also implemented
numerous enhanced security controls and detection mechanisms as well as numerous application
and database security tools. Further, OIT made significant progress towards previously
identified opportunities to improve agency compliance with personal identity verification
controls.

        OIT is committed to protecting information originating from within the SEC as well as
data provided to the SEC from registrants and other parties by adhering to a framework that
focuses on implementing management, operational and technical security controls when
implementing technologies or information systems. While OIT stands ready to support current
and future needs of our audit partners, in fiscal year 2017 OIT will remain focused on efforts to
continuously strengthen the SEC’s cybersecurity posture and protect information stored,
processed, and transmitted by information systems.

Acquisition Management

        I appreciate that your statement recognizes the significant improvements the SEC
continues to make in the acquisition management area. In your statement, you discuss the SEC’s IT
requirements-gathering process and management of the SEC’s protective security force
contract.

        The SEC is committed to ensuring its information technology projects are managed in a
responsible, consistent and effective manner, following federal requirements and proven project
management best practices. As you recognize in your statement, OIT began work on a new IT
Requirements Center of Excellence (RCoE) before the OIG initiated its review of the IT
requirements-gathering process. The RCoE will enable the SEC to improve the quality of
project management practices while helping to ensure OIT can continue to deliver quality and
effective information technology solutions. Specifically, the RCoE will enhance OIT’s




                                                                                    OTHER INFORMATION | 139

           requirements development capabilities through the implementation of a robust project
           management framework, development of standardized templates and project reporting tools, and
           definition of performance metrics. OIT is on schedule to fully deploy the RCoE by December
           2016.

                    With regard to the SEC’s protective security force contract, the Office of Security
           Services worked with the Office of Acquisitions to issue a contract modification effective
           August 31, 2016, which revised the statement of work to clarify and strengthen the requirements
           for training, medical compliance, weapons training and accountability, and accuracy of post
           orders. OSS will ensure the Contracting Officer Representative monitors the contractor
           sufficiently for compliance with the stated terms and conditions of the contract. OSS anticipates
           completing all corrective actions by July 2017.

           Human Capital Management

                   The SEC strives to enhance organizational performance through the implementation of
           human capital strategies that align with the agency’s mission, goals, and objectives. The agency
           is committed to consistently attracting, hiring, developing and retaining a high-performing and
           diverse and engaged workforce. The SEC continues to address the challenges around human capital
           management with a number of strategic initiatives outlined in the Human Capital
           Strategic Plan, SEC Strategic Workforce Plan and specific improvements to operation and
           controls of human resource programs.

                  To address the recommendations for improvement identified in the OIG’s 2016 review of
           the SEC’s hiring process, OHR took the following actions:

                • OHR improved the reliability of hiring data and thereby enhanced its ability to monitor
                  hiring actions through various stages of the process. Recent corrective measures include
                  development of system job aids and targeted training of OHR employees to improve data
                  integrity of the Workforce Transformation Tracking System (WTTS); implementation of
                  quality reviews and monitoring of WTTS data and modified data fields to capture key
                  steps of the service level commitment; and improved controls over the records
                  management process for hiring case files.

                • OHR examined the use of the Quality of Hire Survey results to enhance the hiring
                  process. OHR will continue to conduct quarterly meetings to review the results of the
                  Quality of Hire Survey and potential enhancements to the hiring process; perform mid-
                  year human capital reviews with all SEC Division Directors and Office Heads to discuss
                  human capital related activities in their respective organizations, including the Quality-
                  of-Hire Survey results and their recommendations for improving the hiring process; and
                  hold recurring meetings with the Office of General Counsel to address employee conduct
                  or performance issues identified in the Quality of Hire Survey.

                • OHR enhanced the SEC Quality of Hire Survey tool to include identification of targets
                  for survey participation rates and meeting performance expectations, and development of




140 | 2016 SEC AGENCY FINANCIAL REPORT
Mr. Carl Hoecker

        a process for measurement. OHR deployed the revised survey in early September 2016.
        This version provides the level of detail needed to assess the technical competence of
        new hires help ensure the SEC is hiring people with the appropriate level of competence
        for the agency’s mission-critical occupations.

     • OHR used the mission-critical occupations technical competencies from the newly
       developed SEC Workforce Plan to develop and enhance survey questions that assess the
       core, professional and technical competence of new hires. Also, OHR developed survey
       questions that identify the hiring manager’s role in the hiring process. This allows OHR
       to identify a correlation between hiring management involvement and the quality of the
       new hire. The enhanced Quality of Hire Survey closed in late September 2016. Overall,
       OHR met and exceeded the targeted hiring manager survey participation rate of 90
       percent with an overall survey completion rate of 93 percent. OHR will analyze the
       results of the survey against the performance expectation target goals of 85 percent and
       use the results to discuss possible improvements to the hiring process, as
       applicable. Additionally, OHR will continue to update all quality of hire standard operating
       procedures accordingly.

         Also, with regard to the SEC’s Student Loan Repayment Program, the SEC is actively
addressing the OIG’s recommendations for improvements in this area. OHR has already
strengthened controls around debt collection from employees who separate from the SEC before
fulfilling their service agreements. Ongoing efforts are focused on (1) maintaining complete and
accurate information of all SLRP participants who have participated in the program, participants
who left the agency to go to another federal agency and participants who received waivers; (2)
updating the student loan repayment policy and developing standard operating procedures and
service level commitments that reflect the current program processes and procedures; and (3)
obtaining evidence that the calendar year 2015 participants provided documentation that their
lender(s) received and properly credited the payment to the employee’s account. Some efforts
require OHR to obtain the concurrence of the Union, which we are actively seeking.

         In addition to the OIG recommendations discussed above, OHR is addressing the 2014
OPM evaluation and the 2015 OHR Human Capital Strategy assessment to require written
justifications from recommending officials to support that an employee is likely to leave the SEC
for outside employment if student loan repayment benefits are not approved.

       In FY 2017, OHR will make ongoing improvements to talent management, including
implementation of an integrated Enterprise Talent Management System, and continue to make
progress towards addressing competency gaps identified by supervisors and managers and
meeting the goals and objectives established in the Human Capital Strategic Plan.

                                              ****

       I hope that the actions outlined in this letter demonstrate our commitment to
