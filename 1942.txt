                                 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,
                                           Phi lade lphta,    Pa.,    June 9. 1943.


Sir:
           I have the honor to transmit to you the Eighth .Annual Report. of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, required by the prov1alO118or See-
tion 23 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, approved June 6, 1934,
Section 23 of +he Public Utility Holding CompanyAct of 1935, approved
August 26, 1935, Section 46 (a) of the Investment CompanyAct or 1940,
approved August 22, 1940 and Section 216 of the Investment Advisers Act of
1940, approved August 22, 1940.

           Because of war conditions, we are presenting the report in the
most concise and least expensive manner we can devise.   The statistical
tables have also been substantially   abridged. Data in statistical   tables
customarily shown in previous reports and now omitted are available on
request.

          In March 1942, the Commissionwas movedto Philadelphia by direc-
tion of the Director of the Bureau of the Budget. It was the COIIIIDission's
hope that no issuer who was faced with a deadline in the marketing or securi-
ties would be subjected to any delay by the Commissionbecause of the moving.
Weare happy to report that our hope was realized.

          Respectfully,




                                                       Ganson Purcell,

                   Registration     of Securities    under the Securities        Act of   1933
      For information as to the general scope of the registration  provisions of the Securi-
ties Act o£ 1933, as amended, the registration and examination procedures, the power of
the Commissionto institute    stop-order proceedings to suspend the effectiveness of the
registration   statement, and the statutory amendmentauthorizing the Commissio~in its dis-
cretion to accelerate the effective date of registration   statements, reference is made to
the Sixth Annual Report of the Commission,pp. 117-119, inc., the Seventh Annual Report,
pp, 161-162, inc., and previous annual reports.

    NewRules, Regulations,        and Forms for Registration       under the Securities      Act of 1933

      Further Simplification o£ Registration Forms. In order £urther to simplify the
registration   process, the cOiiiDiissionadopted early in the year two new forms - Fol"Jlls-.2
and Form 5-3. Form S-2 is designed prima.r1ly for securities of small companies. Form S-3
is available for the registration    of shares of mining corporations (other than those in
the oil and gas field) in the promotional or the developlleotal stage.     In the case of both
.fOI'Dl8
       simplification is secured principally by a provision which pemi ts the prospectus
to be .tiled &8 t~ basic part of the registration statement.

                     Act, together with copies of a prospectus containing the information
given in answer to certain designated items on FormN-8B-l and certain additional informa-
tion not required by that form but deemedessential under the Securities Act.

     A number o£ other changes of a minor nature were also made during the year in the
rules and regulations governing registration of securities under the Securities Act.

                             Disclosures resulting       from examination

      Through its examination procedure the CODIIDissionsecured fair and accurate dis-
closure of material information required in registration   statements and prevented the
use in many of these documents of information which 11'&8 misleading and inaccurate.   In
some instances sales of securities were prohibited by the issuance of stop-orders follOlt'-
ing fonual public hearings.

     Of all registrations effective   durin~ the fiscal year ended June 30, 1942,
$476,000,000 were not proposed for 8ale, ,,62,000,000 were registered for sale for the
account of others than the issuers,   and $1,465,000,000 consisted of securities intended
to be sold for the account of issuers.
     Of the total proposed for sale for the account of issuers manufacturing companies
accounted for $462,000,000 or 32 percent, transportation  and commurrl.catd.oncompanies
$446,000,000 or 30 percent, and electric, gas, and water utilities $389,000,000 or :n
percent.

       More than two-thirds of the total value of securities      registered   for cash sale by
issuers or $1,035,000,000 were fixed interest     bearing.     This included $338,000,000 of
secured bonds or 23 percent of the total,   and $697,000,000 of unsecured bonds or 48 per-
cent of the total.     Commonstock amounted to $220,000,000 or 15 percent, followed by
preferred stock with $162,000,000 or 11 percent.       Certificates    of participation,  bene-
ficial  interest,  face-amount installment certificates,     etc., added up to ~48,OOO,OOO    or
3 ~rcent.

      A breakdown by methods of issuance showed that $496,000,000 or 34 percent were
offered directly  by the issuers.   Securities offered on an underwritten basis amounted
to $899,000,000 or 61 percent and those offered on a hest efforts basis aggregated
$70,000,000 or 5 percent.

     Compensation to be paid to distributors   equalled ~23,000,000 or 1.6 percent of the
gross proceeds of the securities  proposed for sale for the account of issuers.    Expenses
amounted to   ts,ooo,ooo
                       or 0.5 percent.    The cost of flotation, therefore,  w?S eqUivalent
to 2.1 percent of the gross proceeds.    This cost was the lowest for any fiscal year since
the series was begun approximately 8 years ago.

      Net proceec18,. after all issuing and distributing    expenses, were estimated at
$1,434,000,000.    Ot these proceeds 51 percent was applied to repayment of indebtedness
and 2 percent to retirement of preferred stock.        Net proceeds to he used for the purchase
of securities   were $83,000,000 or 6 percent, including $67,000,000 used for the purchase of
securities   far investment and $16,000,000 for affiliation.       Newmoney purposes accounted
for $591,000,000 or 4l percent of the total net proceeds.        This included ~333,000,OOO or
23 percent for plant and equipnent and $243,000,000 or 17 percent for working capital.          The
41 percent for nelf money purposes was the greatest proportion of net proceeds for any
fiseal ,ear since the Securities     Act became effective.    The absolute amount intended for
new mone,. purposes was the largest amount to be applied from corporate securities       to fixed
and 'WOrkingcapital of any fiscal year since 1937.

to the Department of Justice, and criminal proceedings are instituted   in the discre-
tion of the Attorney General of the United States.    In the event such proceedings
are instituted,   the attorneys and engineers on the Commissionstaff who participated
in the investigation   leading up to the proceedings assist the United States Attorneys
in the preparation of the cases for presentation to the grand jury and for trial.

                          of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

      During the past fiscal year extensive hearings were held before the Committee on
Interstate  and Foreign Commerceof the House of Representatives on various proposals
to amend the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
                                              - 5 -
     Beginning in July 1940, the Comnissionand its staff conferred almost continuous-
ly with representatives of the securitieS' industry and other interested persons on a
large number- of proposals to amendvarious provisions of the 1933 and 1934 Acts. The
conferees consisted priw~ily of representatives of the Investment Bankers Association
of America, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., the NewYork Curb
Exchange and the NewYork Stock Exchange, although both the Commission'sstaff and
member-s of the Corrunissionthemselves met also with representatives of the regional
exchanges and other intere~ted persons. rne purpose of these conferences was to de-
fine the areas of agreement and disagreement on the various proposals. A substantial
area of agreement was found, although the Commissionfelt compelled to oppose certain
cf the securities industry's proposals.

      On August 7, 1941. the Commissionsubmitted to the House Committeeon Interstate
and Foreign Com~erceand the Senate Committeeon Banking and Currene,ya 54-page re-
port on the various proposals for amendmentof the 1933 and 1934 Acts. On July 30,
1941, a 2a7-page report had been submitted by the representatives of the four indus-
try groupe above named. Beginning on October 28, 1941, the Committeeon Interstate
and Foreign Commerceof the House of Representatives held hearings on the various
proposals of the securities industry and of the .Commission. These proposals were
el'lbodied in a comparative CommitteePrint rather than a bill.

      The hearings were also concerned with three bills which had been introduced in-
dependently of the Commission-industry conferences. H. R. 4344 had been introduced
by Repres entati ve Wadsworthof NewYork on April 14, 1941, to amendvarious provi-
sions ot the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934, the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, the Invesbnent Company   Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940. H. R. 5065 had been introduced by Representative Paddock of Illinois on
June 16, 1941, to amendSection 2 (1) of the Securities Act of 1933-in order to exempt
from the de.fini tion of the term "security" interests in employees' investment plans.
H. R. 5g32 had been introduced by Representative Oliver of Maine on October 15, 1941,
to amend3ection 12 (f) of the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934 in order to prevent
national ~ecurities exchanges from extending unlisted trading privileges to any se-
curity not listed and registered on a national securities exchange.

     These hear-ings continued until December5, 1941, and as a result of the declara-
tion of war were interrupted until January 20, 1942. They were concluded on January Z7,
1942, and the transcript has been printed in five volumes plus an index volume.

      No bills embodyingany of the proposals made by the securities industry or the
Commissionhave as yet been intiroduced. The Commissiondid not initiate the amendment
                                        very largely to those which it deemednecessary
program, and it -eonrtned its PI'C?POSals
in the light o.f certain of the proposals o.f the securities industry. Only a few addi-
tional proposals, of a corrective nature, were made by the Commission. Noneof the
Commission's proposals would enlarge the area of the Canmission's jurisdiction.

         This pr-ogramconstituted   one of the Canmission's major tasks during the past
fiscal     year.

          The general purpose and nature of registration of securities on exchanges end
     the Commission's procedure in examining applications and reports for conpliance with
     the requirements of Sections 12 and 13 of the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934, have
     been described in the Sixth Annual Report of the Conmdssion, pp. 100-102, inc., and
     previous annual reports.

     1942, the Commissionrevised its Rule X-12A-5,      which provides temporary exemption
     of certain securities from registration under Section 12 of the Act. The revision
     broadens the scope of the rule and sets forth definite bases for termination of the
     exemption.


     Y    '!his rule became effective February 19, 1942. At the same time the Commission
          adopted and made effective companionRules 171 under the Securities Act of 1933
          and U-105 under the Public utility Holding CompanyAct of 1935 providing for cor-
          responding wartime censorship of information fUed under these additional Acts.
          Under these three rules procedure has been established whereby the Commission,in
          cooperation with the Office of Censorship, will upon request render advance, in-
          formal opinions in cases where issuers, underwritars, or other persons are in
          doubt 88 to the extent to which, or the manner in which, particular information
          may be disclosed in a registration  statement, prospectus, report, or other document.

     zj   furing the last three months of the fiscal year approximately 2,700 filings under
          Sections 12 and 13 were examinedunder Rule x-s and made available for public
          inspection.

          curities and ExchangeAct, the "12A" that it is based on Section 12 (a) of that

      DIlr1ng the year, registrations on national securities exchanges of the securities
or 6 issuers were ordered nthdrawn, under Section 19 (a) (2), upon failure to fUe the
annual reports required under Section 13. Proceedings under this Section involving 3

Applications tor the granting, extension and termination of unlisted     trading privileges
                             on National securIties EXchanges

     On June 30, 1942, unlisted trading privileges  under clause (1) of Section 12 (f) ot
the Securities Exchange Act or 1934 continued in 1,341 stock and 192 bond issues.   This
is a reduction ot 32 stock and 29 boud issues !'rom the total as ot June 30, 1941.

      On June 30, 1942, unlisted trading privileges under clauses (2) and (3) of See-
tion 12 (t) existed nth respect to 255 stock and 34 boud issues, trading in odd lots
onlJ' being au:thorized with respect to 12 or the stock issues. Except for 14 issues sub-
sequentq removed, these issues represent the total extension by the COIIID:i.ssion
                                                                                 of un-
listed trad1Dg privileges to the national securities exchanges under these two clauses
since va;, Z7, 1.936, when the clauses became effective.

      Since Tar10us issues are admitted to unlisted trading privileges on more than one
exchange, the authorizations mentioned above involve substantial. duplication of issues ot
securities covered thereby.   On June 30, 1942, 1,596 stock and 226 bond trading authoriza-
tions were in effect UDderclauses (1), (2) and (3), covering 1,065 stock and 226 bond
issues counting each issue once onlJ'. The latter figures include 508 stock and 200 bond
issues which are admitted to unlisted trading privileges onlJ'; the remaining issues are
tully listed and registered (or, in a few cases, temporarily exempted trom registration)
on national. securities exchanges other than those having unlisted trading privileges
therein.

      During the Past fiscal year, 26 applications were fUed with the Commissionby ex-
changes seekiDg a detemination that an altered or substituted security was substantially
equivalent to a security theretofore admitted to unlisted trading privileges. Of these
applications, 22 were granted and 4 were denied.

      Towardthe end or the past tiscal year the National Association or Securities Deal-
ers, Inc. intervened in opposition to applications of the NewYork Curb Exchange tor the
extension of unlisted trading privileges in 3 bond issues pursuant to cl.ause (3) of See-
tion 12 (f) and in 1 stock issue pursuant to clause (2) thereof.   The matter had not been
disposed or by the end or the year.

                                       Exempted exchanges
      The D1DIberor exempted exchanges permitting unlisted trading in secur.l.ties remained
at rour, aDd the totals of stock and bond issues admitted to unlisted trading thereon
were 75 aDd 4, respectiv~,     on June 30, 1942. Twoof the five stock issues admitted to
unlisted trading on the Wheeling Stock Exchange under Clause 2 or Section 12 (t) during
the 1940 fiscal. )'ear were removed' in 1941, by reason of exchange 1Dto another stock.

                                    Special offering       plana

      During the fiscal. year ~ three national. securities exchanges adopted plans which per--
mit special. of"ferings of blocks of certain securities to be eff"ected on their respective
floors.   These plans provide that a special. offering JI87 be made when it is determined
that the auction market on the noor or the exchange cannot absorb a particular      block of
a security within a reasonable time and at a reasonable price.      111eplana permit a per-
son making such an offering to pay a special. cOllllll1ss1onto the brokers of the purchasing
customers and stiPUlate also that such brokers shall not receive arJ¥ cCllll,P911sation
                                                                                      b'<a
their awn customers. Provision al.so is made for the appropriate designation on the a-
change ticker tape of transactions    effected as part of a special offering and for appro-
priate confirmations to customers, describing the special. character of" the transaction.

      In order to permit such plans to be instituted  on an exper1JaeD.tal basis, the Cal-
mission, f"ollowing con£erences between its staff 8Ddbrokers and exchange of£icials,
amended its Rule X-1OB-2, which in general prohibits an:r person engaged in distributing
a security from compensating any other person tor solicUing or inducing a third person
to buy' on an exchange the di~tributed security or a:Jq other security o£ the same issuer.
111eeffect of the amendment, adopted February' 6, 1942, is to exapt tran the restrictions
at the rule transactions lIhich are effected pursuant to a special offering plan which haa
been declared effective bT the Camn1ssion. The exemption, however, was declared to be
only temporary, to expire on July 31, 1942.          Y
      Pursuant to the terms of this 8X8111ption, the CCllllllissiondeclared effective,  as of
February 14, 1942, a plan submitted ~ the He- York Stock Exchange.          Similar act1011was
taken with respect to a plan of the San Francisco stock Ez.change (effective Aprill?,
1942), and with respect to a plan of the NewYork Curb Ez.chaDge(effective llq lS, 19.42).
Various modifications in the terms of these three pl.aDa have alao been deolared e.t.teotift
bT the COIIIIDission.Moreover" on April 16, 1942, -the CClIIIIIisaion broadened the e:x:wptlicm
to Rule X-10B-2 to include specia1. offerings in oertain issues haring unlisted. trading
privileges,  provided that in:tormation is ava:Uable nth respect to such securities       lip-
prax:lmating that available for listed securities.

                 .tour aDd one-hal1' aonths of the fiscal year, during which t:l.- the plaD
         In the last
was operative, 19 special. offerings were made on the liew York stock Exchange. Neither the
NewYork Curb Exchange nor the San Francisco stock Exchange had aunounced any special
offerings bT the close of the fiscal year.




y   On Jul1' 8, 1942, the ~tion      W8B   extended to January 31, 1943.   (Securities   Exchange
    Act Release No. 32?0).

                            Aids to bookkeeping standards

      During the past year the Commission staff prepared a series of fifteen forms on
which the information necessary to comply with the requirements of Rule X-17A-3 (a)
could be conveniently recorded.  Such forms were furnished to all regional officeS fer
distribution  amongbrokers and dealers.   The use of the forms is optional.  They repre-
sent a conveniently uni.ft>Tm manner of recording information required to be kept by the
rule.
                            Study of the Regional Exchanges

      As a part of a general study of current developments in the securities markets, and
at the request of officials of various regional exchanges, representatives   of the Can-
mission during the fiscal year undertook field studies of the problems of the regional.
exchanges. By the close of the fiscal year, Camnission representatives had visited
Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Salt Lake City, San Fran-
cisco, Seattle, and Spokane, to investigate the problems of the exchanges located in
those cities.   The study had not been canpleted at the close of the year.

                 study of over-the-counter     markets in exchange stocks

      A study of the characteristics of over-the-counter transactions in exchange stocks,
which was begun in the preceding fiscal year, was continued throughout the past year.
One phase of the study was completed during the year and the results were published on
February 5, 1942, under the title "RePOrt to the Caom1ssion by the Trading and Exchange
Division on Secondary Distributions of Exchange stocks".    'Ihis report dealt with the
nature, developnent, and magnitUde of over-the-counter offerings of outstanding blocks
of exchange stocks.

      Substantial progress also was made in the second major phase of this study, dealing
with over-the-counter transactions in exchange stocks other than secondary distributions.
Approximately 250,000 transactions,  representing every such over-the-counter transaction
in every exchange stock reported by 4,700 brokers and deaJ.ers in the six months ending
February 28, 19411'l8r8 tabulated in various ways and subjected to a number of different
analyses.   At the end of the fiscal year, however, the results were not yet in form far
public release.

                                      Saving study

      The COIIlIDission
                      on April 15, 1942, inaugurated a series of quarterly releases on the
volume and canposition of saving by individuals in the United States.     These releases
show the aggregate volume of individuals'   savings; i.e., the increase in their assets
less the increase in their liabilities,   exclusive of gains or losses from revaluation of
assets; they show also the canponents contributing to this total, such as bank baJ.ances
and currency holdings, insurance, securities,    consumers' indebtedness, and consumers'
durable goods. Estimates of business or government saving are not included.

                     Rule for additional     protection   to investors

     During the fiscal year the Commissionadopted Rule X-10B-5 as an additional protec-
tion to investors.   The new rule prohibits fraud by any person in connection with the
purchase of securities,  while the previously existing rules against fraud in the purchase
of securities applied only to brokers and dealers.

                        Market surveillance and trading investigations

      The Commission's aim in its adninistration of the statutory prohibitions of the
Securities ExchangeAct of 1934 against stock market manipulation is a sufficient pol-
icing of the markets in order to accanplish the extinction of manipulation without in-
terfering with the legitimate functioniDg of those markets. Its methods of market SUI'-
veillance and its investigatory procedure are set forth at pages 91 et seq. of the Sixth
Annual Report of this CaDmission.

!IA flying  quiz is a quick informal survey of the trading in a security to determine if'
  add!tiona! investigation is warranted.

~ Includes reference of cases to the Department of Justice and to various national se-
  curities exchanges.

                      Pegging, fixing,   and stabilizing   of securities       prices

                                                                  continued the administra-
      During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1942, the COIIIIIIission
tion of (a) Rul.eX-17A-2,which requires the filing of detailed rePOrts of all transac-
tions incident to offerings in respect of which a registration statement has been filed
under the Securities Act of 1933 where any stabilizing operation is undertaken to facili-
tate the offering; and (b) Regulation X-9A6-1,governing stabilizing transactions in se-
curities registered. on national securities exchanges effected to facilitate  oUerings of
securities so registered in lIhich the offering prices are represented to be "at the
market" or at prices related to market prices.

     Out of a total of 235 registration  stateaents filed under the Securities Act of 1933
during the past .fiscal year, 129 contained a statement of intention to stabilize to facil-
itate the offerings covered by such registration statements. Because of the fact that a
                                            -12-
registration  statement in some cases covers more than one offering, there were a total of
148 offerings of securities   in respect of which the statement required by Rule 827 of the
Rules and Regulations UDder the securities Act of 1933 was made to the effect that a
stabilizing  operation was intended to be undertaken. Stabilizing operations were actually
conducted to facilitate  91 of these offerings.   In the case of bonds, public offerings of
$311,192,300 principal amount were stabilized.    Offerings of stock issues aggregating
8,729,964 shares and having an aggregate estimated public offering price of $288,356,806
were also stabilized.   ot the 91 stabilizing operations eeemenced during the past fiscal
year, 80 had been c<:llIp1etedand notices of termination of sta,bilization filed with the
COIIIIDission
            and the rema1"1ng II were still  in progress as of the close of the fiscal year.

     Also during the past fiscal. year, 5 notices of intention to stabilize were filed with
the COIIIIIIission
                 on FozmX-9A6-l pursuant to the provisions of Rule X-9A6-3. The offerings
described in these notices, to facilitate  which stabilizing  operations were conducted, in-
volved one offering of bonds of $2,470,000 princiPal amount, and stock issues aggregating
211,900 shares and having an aggregate initial. public offering price of $8,310,675.

     With a view toward simplifying the procedure for we reporting of transactions eff~c-
ted by persons engaged in stabilizing activities  the COIIIIDission
                                                                 adopted on July 29, 1941
a new FozmX-17A-1, with instructions  therefor.   This new form was designed to be "self-
proving" and to replace the three fozms required to be filed by those persons subject to
the provisions of Rule X-17A-2or Regulation X-9A6-1. An amendmentto Rule X-17A-2,
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, required by the adoption of the new form, was
also adopted on that date.

      To simplify further the filing of stabilizing   reports, the Commissionadopted on
February 13, 1942 an amendmentto Rule X-17A-2, eliminating the necessity of filing re-
ports in triplicate   and making it unnecessary, in most cases, for a stabilizer  to file a
report for any day on which his transactions are confined to retail sal.es of the offered
security at the fixed public offering price.     Certain other minor changes were made in
the rule for clarification.    The instructions for Form X-17A-l were also revised to conform
to the amendmentto the rule.




      The COIIIIDission's
                        first proceeding under Section 19 (b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, which section empowersthe Commissionunder certain conditions to al.ter or
supplement the rules of an exchange in respect of certain matters if the exchange itself
refuses to make such changes, was closed by an order of the Commission. 5/ This order
which was entered after extended hearings and argument required that Section 8 of
Article XIV (formerly Article XVI) of the Constitution of the NewYork Stock Exchange be
amendedto contain the following proviso:




i/ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 3053. See also Securities Exchange Act Release
   No. 3033. section 8 of Article XIV (formerly Article XVI) was amendedby the NewYolk
   Stock Exchange to contain the required proviso, effective October 6, 1941.
                                            - 13 -
      "**""nothingherein contained shall be construed to prohi bit any member, allied
      memberor memberfirm from, or to penalize any such firm for, acting as an odd-
      lot dealer or specialist or otherwise publicJy dealing- for his or its own account

      exchange located outside the City of NewYork (of which such member, allied
      memberor memberfirm is a member)in securities listed or traded on such other
      exchange."

     No appeal was taken by the ~change from the order of the Conmission. Manyof the
smaller exchanges had protested vigorously against the rule as it stood and was 1nterpreted
by the .c:xchangeprior to the ordered amendment.

                       Exchanges Registered and Exemptedfrom Registration

     During the past fiscal year there was no change in the number of exchanges registered
with the Conmission as national securities exchanges, nor did any change occur in the num-
ber of exchanges exempted from such registration.

                                   OVER-THE-COUNTER   MARKETS

                 CommissionSupervision of Over-The-Coun'terBrokers and Dealers

       In the year ended June JO, 19.42the Commissionreceived from its regional offices,
1,054 reports of inspections of registered brokers and dealers.       These inspections are
based on exam:!  Dation of books and records only and are designed to test compliance with
the statutes aand rules and regulations thereunder.       Prominent points covered are best
illustrated   by a brief summar.Y of the findings of these inspections.    In 368 inspections
there were found irregularities    which may be classified as follows: 112 instances of
unsatisfactory or precarious financial condition; 65 instances of improper use of customers:
funds or securities (only 18 of which involved firms whose financial condition was not
unsatisfactory);    161 instances of transactions at prices which tended to indicate that
sales had been made to customers at prices not reasonably related to the current market;
and 28 instances of secret profits, involving misrepresentations as to the prices at which
customers' orders had been executed. In many other cases involving the sale of oil royalty
interests it was found that sales to customers were at prices grossly in excess of the cost
to the dealer.

                                    Administrative Remedies

      PubJ.ic interest and protection of customers are factors which the Conmission must
weigh and consider prior to the application ot a statutory remedy upon consideration of
irregularities    ot the sort described above. In the course of our examination of the books
ot registered brokers and dealers cases are t'requentlyencountered involving unsatis-
tactory financial condition or improper hypotheca'tion of customers'securities.          In many
cases, circumstances suggest that the violations are unintentional.         The inspection pro-
gram being, in part, educational, it has been the Commission's policy, before considering
statutory remedies, to give opportunity to firms to correct such conditions.           In one case
a firm. had improperly pledged customers' fully paid for securities bllt officers whowere
aJ.so principal stockholders disclaimed knowledge of the situation and promptly contributed
more than $40,000 to the corporation, discharged. responsible employees and reorganized
the bua1neS8.     Subsequent surveiJ,J.ance failed 'to disclose further irregularities    by the
firm.

     In the case of Ver Hulst & Co., Inc. of Denver, Colorado,      Y
                                                                 the COlIIDission,on

instituted   proceedings in February, 1.942 to determine whether the firm's registration
shouJ.d be revoked and whether it should be suspended or expelled from membership in the
N.A.S.D. SUbsequent1.y'the firm requested withdrmral .of its registration,      representing
that it had paid or arranged to pq $55,000 satisfying all creditors and protecting
customers .from the possibility  of 1.08S, that it was in the process of going out cJt rosiness
and contempl.ated disso1.ution, that it had resigned .from the N.A.S.D., and that the regis-
trant's   President, George M. Ver Hu1.st, wouJ.dnot again enter the securities business.
Under these circumstances, the CODIDi.ssion  found that withdr8ll'al. wouJ.dnot be inconsist4tnt
with the public interest and the protection of investors and ordered, on April. 22, 1.942,
that the withdrawal. application be permitted to become effective.

      In the case of Morrison Bond Co., Ltd., of Long Beach, California, 7/ a similar pro-
ceeding was instituted  by"the Commissionon information that the company  bad f'1l.ed a
petition under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act to effect an arrangement .nth unsecured
creditors.   The companyproposed to continue its lroker-dealer business.     On April 8
registration  was revoked and the firm was expelled from the N.A.S.D. on findings of mis-
leading representations and fraudulent omissions of material. facts in the sale of securi-
ties, wilful violations of the hypothecation ral.es and al.terations and faJ.se entries in
its books and records.   It was stated in the Commission's opinion that the Commissionwas
convinced that the false entries had been made "to awid discovery of the fact that it
(the firm) has violated the Commission's hypothecation rule."

      As a result of information obtained in some inspections, civil suits were fUed and
permanent injunctions obtained, the defendants consenting, against Kimball, Ware & Co.,
Port1and, 1Ia:ine, Seybolt & Seybo1t, Inc., Springfield, )(ass., John ll. WJatt & Co., n
Paso, Texas, and HartIumn Inc., Wheeling, W. Va. In twe1w instances facta relating to
serious financial. condition were referred tq the Attorney' General of the State of NewYork
who, after independent iJIquiry, obtained injunctions against ri1ne of the firms involved.
One injunction was later vacated. '!'he cap!.tal position of each of the three remai"i ng
firms 11'&8 adjusted aDd no action against th_ wu taken.

      The most difficuJ.t current problem arising out of regulation of over-the-counter
lrokers and dealers stems from the practice of selling securities at prices which bear
no reasonable relationship to current market.      yIn such cases extensive investigations
beyond the limits of books and records must be ma4ie. These investigations    tax to the
utmost the limited staff of the Commissionnow available for such 'WOrk. They require the
cO!'1Pilation of voluminous price schedules and the reconstruction of market prices at the
time the transactions took place.    Customers must be interviewed to determine what
representations were made to induce the transactions and whether material facts were con-
ceal.ed from t hem. In a number of investigations madE! during the Past year the evidence
disclosed a pattern of fraudulent conduct which resulted in the formal proceedings.      The
chief remedy'employed in such cases is the revOcation of the firm's registration,    coupled
with expul.s!on from the N.A.S.D. where the firm is a memberof that Association.




21 Securities   ~hange   Act Release No.   3189.
y   In Jul:y 1942 the Trading and Exchange Division offered to the industry for cOlllDenta
    proposed rule wbich would require the disclosure to the customer of the best available
    market far a security before the canpletion of a transaction in that security.
                                       - 15 -
      In ten of the cases decided during the year 9/ revocation of re gistration was
ordered because of fraudulent over-reaching of the character just described.     Seven
of these finns were also expelled from membershipin the N.A.S.D. Of the ten cases
referred to above, two 10/ involved not only the sales of securities at prices in-
consistent with prevai11iig market prices but also gross abuse of a relationship of
trust and confidence which the firms had established with their customers. Both
cases are of importance on the question of agency,

      In its findings and opinion in the Allender case, the Camnission discussed the
legal principle that words alone on a "confirmation" to a custcaer do not establish
the relationship between the parties and held that "the words 'we have this day sold
to you' and 'bought fran you' do not of themselves contravene the existence of an
agency relationship between the respondent and its customers and do not justif,y res-
pondent's failure to disclose its secret profits."   The canplete reliance of the cus-
tomers on the firm's advise, the unequal circwnstances of the parties in the transac-
tion, and complete trust and confidence in the firm were held to impose upon it the
duty to makefull and complete disclosure of all material facts.

      In the Stelmack case the evidence showedthat the firm obtained lists of holdings
from certain customers and then sent to these customers analyses of their securities
with recommendationslisting securities to be retained, to be disposed of, and to be
acquired. The firm's order b.Lanka, which customers signed, stated "I hereby authorize
you as my agent, for my account and risk • • • to sell •••    buy," but also contained
language which authorized the firm, as principal, to "buy from or sell to me • • • at
prices to be fixed by you and I hereby ratify and confirm any transaction effected by
you pursuant hereto."   The eammissionheld that the conduct of the customers in solic-
iting the advice of the firm, their obvious expectation that it would act in their
best interests,  their reliance on its recommendations, and the conduct of the firm in
making its advice and services available to them and in soliciting their confidence,
pointed strongly to an agency relationship and that the very function of furnishing
investment counsel constitutes a fiduciary function.   As to the order form, the Can-
mission held that where the language of a documentor a course of conduct thereunder
create an agency, other provisions in the documentexplicitly negating the e.x1stence
of an agency are of no effect.

      The Stelmack case in important in another respecc , One of the admitted charges
which the Connnissionfound to be in violation of the fraud provisions of the Securities
Act and the Securities ExchangeAct was that, while the corporation was engaged in
selling its own preferred stock, it failed to disclose to the purchasers thereof' that
it had submitted false and misleading financial reports to the Office of the Attorney
General in that State which in effect permitted the registrant to remain in business
only at the peril of discovery by the Attorney General.

                                        Rules

      The CClIIIIIIission
                      t s experience during the year ended June 30, 1.942with broker-dealer
registrations  is shown in the tabulations accanp~g        this report.  Briefly, there 1rU
a net decline of 508 registrants     to 5,557 as of the end of the period.  It is clear
that the war effort is a basic cause of at least part of this shrinkage.

                   The National Association     of Securities   Dealers,   Inc.

      The CClIIIIIIission'
                       s efforts in regulating the over-the-counter industry have been
aided by the cooperation of National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (N.A.S.D)
pursuant -to Section l5A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, otherwise known as the
Maloney Act. During the year under review N.A.S.D. continued as the onJ..y national se-
curities association registered as such with the CClIIIIIIission.

     Due largely to diversion of personnel of its membership into war activities,
membership in that Association suffered a 12.8% decline frClll 2,974 membersas of
July 1, 1941 to 2,593 as of June 30, 1942.

                                     Examination progr_

     As of June 30, 1942 the Association had cClllpleted, large~  through questionnaires,
its initial  exarnjnation of more than 2,200 members. Less than 700 membersthen remAined
uninspected.   These examinations, conducted by each of the fourteen District Business
Conduct Camnitteesi under the general supervision of the main office of the Association,
                                                - 17-
   delve into the business practices of memberswith emphasis upon the compliance with the
   Rules of Fair Practice.   Reports of examination which indicate violations of the
'. Association's rules result in the filing of either formal or informal complftints by the
   appropriate District BUsiness Conduct Committee. The scope and results of these dis-
   ciplinary actions are discussed subsequently.

                           Cases referred   by the COJJmlission
                                                              to the NASD

         The Association's examination program outlined above is not the only source of
¥~ disciplinary  action against members. The Commission.. as a matter of policy, frequently
   refers to the Association information uncovered in its own inspection which appears to
 , concern either unfair prices or other violations of the Association's rules.

           On July 1, 1941 there were before the Association 11 cases which had previously
     been referred to it by the Commissionand, in the ensuing year, 46 other cases were re-
     ferred.   In that time the Association disposed of 46 cases and it held pending 11 cases
     on June 30, 1942. Of the cases disposed of 23 were handled informally and in the re-
     maining cases 23 formal canplaints were filed which resulted in five expulsions, two
     suspensions, three fines and censures, six fines, four censures" and no action or
     penalty in three instances.

                                 Disciplinary   proceedings by NASD

          In disciplinary matte"'s, minor or technical infractions  of the Association's rules
     are generally handled ~            and usually result in no more than a formal censure,
     but in more serious ma't'ters formal complaints are filed by the Association which may
     have as their consequence expulsion" suspension, fine or censure or any combination of
     those penalties.

          On July 1, 1941 there were pending before the Association 19 formal canplaints and
     132 additional canplaints were filed in the following year.   Of these 151 cases, 130 were
     disposed of :in the year and 21 remained in proeess on June 30.. 1942.

          Formal complaints were withdrawn or dismissed without penalty in 25 instances; 32
     respondents were censured] 47 were fined .. :in amounts ranging from $25 to $2000; 12 were
     suspended for periods of fran thirty days to one year; and 24 respondents were expelled.
     Cases referred by the Commissionare included in this summary.

           In 20 cases decisions of District Business Conduct Committees came before the
     Board of Governors for review. The Board affirmed three decisions; dismissed one can-
     plaint in which a BlUIiness Conduct Committeehad censured and imposed a $250 fine;
     modified a decision of suspension, censure and $1500 fine to censure and $300 fine; and
     modified a decision of "strong censure" and $100 fine to eliminate the censure.    One
     appeal for review was withdrawn and 12 cases were Pending June 30, 1942.

          A District  Business Conduct CCllllIlitteedecision ot censure and $250 fine, affirmed
     by the Board of Governors  was brought by the respondent to the Camnission for review
     but b;y June 30, 1942 no action had been taken.

     technical in substance and codifies on a national scale what was generally recognized
     as sound practice in the securities business.

      Amendmentsto    -Laws and Rules of Fair Practice.    On June 15, 1942 the Association
forw          the membership for approval. or disapproval an elaborate revision of the By-
Laws and Rules of Fair Practice after the Board of Governors on May 18 and 19, 1942 had
recommendedits adoption. IIan;T of the proposed changes only eliminated from the rules of
the Association reference to a predecessor organization or material which was of value
onJ.y in the original organization and registration   of the Association.  Other changes in-
volved language or detail in which some ambiguity existed or in which experience indicated
the necessity for alteration to make the material consistent with the statutes or rules of
the Commission.

      Of paramount importance was an amendmentwhich would require, as a condition to
membership, minimum net capital, exclusive of fixed assets of ssooo for "clearing firms"
or $2500 for "non-clearing firms." -gJ other changes included authority to assess a
disciplined membersome part of the cost of the proceedings in lrilich he was involved and
a requirement that membersshould diligent1y supervise the activities   of salesmen.

Integration   and Corporate Simpl1i'ication of Public Utility   HOldingCO!!l1?8l1Y
                                                                               SY8tems

      In the past fiscal year, the .major activities   of the C01IIII1ission
                                                                          in its adminis-
tration of the Public Utility Holding CompanyAct of 1935 revolved around the enforce-
ment of the integration and simplification provisions of the Act. In several impor-
tant cases we have entered orders prescribing most of the action which IIIl18t be t8ken
ultimately to comply with the requirements of Section 11, particularly Section 11 (b)
(1) • As to the remaining cases, a majority of the proceedings have reached the stage
where such orders may be expected in the near future.      In the course of these proceed-
ings the Commissionhas had occasion to pass upon manyof the disputed questions of
interpretation   of the Act, and the lIllUUltementsof most of the holding cOlllpS.Dy
                                                                                   systems
are nOlI'either substantially advised 88 to, or 'in a position to judge the soope of,
the action which we will order to be taken to bring about compliance with Section ll.
A number of companies have appealed our orders to the courts and the csses nOlI'pending
in the courts should settle most of the legal questions still     in dispute.   Weare
therefore moving toward completion of the first stage of entering orders and getting
the legal form21ities behind us, especially with respect to procednre and interpreta-
tion. Whenthat stage is completed with respect to the various holding companysystems,
each will knOll' definitely where it stands in relation to the requirements of Section 11.
Howand when such orders shall be enforced, is a matter for future determine.tion in
most of the cases.

     "fe have not proceeded as yet under Section 11 (d) for enforcement ot our Section
II (b) orders by the oourts.   A significant result ot the progress that we have made
in nearing the completion of the first stage ot the administration of Section 11 is
that manyof the major systelll8 have nOlI'evidenced a willingness to proceed with the
task of carrying out our orders.    To that end several of the systems have filed
voluntarJr plans and others are engaged in doing so and 1n_ discussing their proposals
with us. In fact, with few exceptions we are finding an increasiiigtendency on the
part of the holding companysystems to facilitate    either the entering of orders, or
the trial of cases instituted by us, or compliance with the Act. In view ot the
progress already made, or in prospect, the Commission's major adm:1nistrative concern
today relates to the tinal steps ~ achieVing the objectives of the statute, namely,
the choice between the various alternative methods available under the Act for bring-
ing about compliance with the requirements of Section 11 (b), and the determination
of what treatment of the various claims of security holders is fair and equitable.

       IUring the 1942 fiscal year, the Commissioninstituted 26 new proceedings looking
to orders requiring registered public utility holding companies to complywith Section
II of the Act and at the close of the fiscal year, 48 such proceedings were pending.
'lhese 4S proceedings involve substantially 2ll of the public utility holding company
systems registered under the Act although they do not encompassall of the Section 11
problems existing in such systems. In this connection, it may be noted that as of
June 30, 1942, there were registered with the Commission134 public utility holding
companies, the total consolidated book assets of which amount to approximately
$16,000,000,000, or about 6S percent of the private electric and gas utility industry
of the United States.      'lhose 134 registered holding companies constitute 53 public
utility holding companysystems, which include 1,342 holding, subholding and operating
companies. HOlI'ever,about 14 of them control total consolidated assets ot
$12,195,000,000 and approximately 52':'€of the privately ownedelectric generating
capacity of the country. 'lhe holding companysystems involved in Section 11 proceed-
ings as of June 30, 1942 had consolidated assets which aggregated $14,237,000,000.

                        Section 11 (b) (1) - Geographic Simplification

      The past fiscal year has seen rapid strides toward ultimate compliance by all hold-
ing companysystems with the geographic integration provisions of the Act. As related
in last year's annual report, thE' previous year was chiefiy noted for the holding of
public hearings as to the major holding companysystems and the entry of initial     orders
as to SClllle of them. At the close of that year, however, the records in most of those
proceedings had not been completed, and there remained to be instituted   additional pro-
ceed1.np;sas to several systems constituting  a minor portion of the industry subject to
the Act.

     The more significant developments in the administration    of Section 11 (b) (1) of the
Act in the past fisca1 year may be summarized as follows:

     (1)   Hearings were completed in most of the integration proceedings instituted
           prior thereto and substantially   completed in all others, including a number
           begun during the year. The Section 11 (b) (1) records were completed with'
           reSPect to the following systems: Cities Service Power & Light Company,
           Consolidated Electric and Gas Company,Engineers Public Service Company,
           Great Lakes Utili ties Company,Lone star Gas Corppration, The Middle West
           Corporation, North American Gas and Electric Company,Southern Union Gas
           Company,Standard Gas and Electric Company,United Public Utilities      Corpora-
           tion and Utilities   Stock & Bond Corporation.  The record in the Associated
           Gas and Electric Corporation proceeding was completed on substantially    all
           of the issues.

     (2)   Important, far-reaching orders were entered by the Commissionprescribing
           most of the steps which certain of the major systems must take to canply
           with Section 11 (b) (1) • Attention is directed to the CommissionI e orders
           in the following cases:

                                                                Holcting CompanyAct

   Philadelphia Electric Companyand Public Service Corporation of NewJersey) by a
   distribution  of such assets amongits stockholders.    We approved the plan on
   March 18, 1943 (Holding CompanyAct Release No. 4173). A petition for review of our
   order of approval has been fUed by stockholders of U.G.1. Our order in the North

     Twoof the bond issues, aggregatirl..g$39,243,000, were bid in by insurance companies,
and investment banking houses or groups thereof were the successful bidders for the re-
mainder. Twoof the preferred stock issues were the subject of "basket bids" with bonds
of the same com~.!".ies. In a few cases, the successful bid was that of the traditional
underwriter.

~       Prior to the adoption of' the competitive bidding rule, the COIIIIIl1ssicm.  statf'
                                                                                      1s    had
   made a stud;y' of underwriting spreads prevailing during the five-year period ending
,-"1
   January 1, 1940. It was fown that slight~       over one-hal! of the 159 utUitiy' mortgage
 _~bond issues covered by the study were sold by underwriters on the basis ot a two-point
   spread and that the spread fell below that level in only four cases.      '!he average spread
   for the 159 issues sold under the traditional    method of private negotiation was 2.49
 ~ points ($2.49 per $100 bond) •

 •e        As mentioned in Part 1, under "Securities Effectively Registered", the cost of
 :; flotation of corporate securities was the lowest during this fiscal year that it has been
    in the approximately eight-year period over which the Cormnissionhas kept records thereof.
    The decline in underwriting spreads has been most noticeable in the offerings under
    Rule U-50. The spread in 6 of the 13 mortgage bond issues offered to the plblic           '1/
    following bids made under this rule was less than one point per issue, a circumstance
    not equalled in other recent corporate offerings except for a number of serial issues
    (principa.lly railroad equipnent issues which are also required to be sold through com-
    petitive bidding).    The spread, in percent of dollar proceeds registered tor sale under
    the Securities Act, averaged 1.12 for the 15 "bank quaJ.ity" bond issues offered to the
    public following bids made under this rule, canpared with about 1.9 for 26 -bank
    quall ty" bond issues registered under the securities Act and offered to the pablic be-
    tween Yay 7, 1941 and June 30, 1942 but not subject to Rule U-50.

                                                Exemption Cases

             Generally speaking, Sections 2 and 3 o£ the Act contain definiticm.s aDd exemption
        provisions pursuant to which the COIIIII1ssion
                                                     determines whether companies are subject to
        the regulatory provisions of the Act.

             In the past fiscal year the Commissiondisposed of applications filed by Moreau
       Manufacturing Company,      y
                                   Pacific Gas and Electric Company9/ and Public service Corpora-
       tion of NewJersey     !£/each of which sought t.o be declared not to be a subs1d1.ary of
       specified companies. All of' these applications were denied because the COIIIIissioncould
       not find that the applicants were not subject to the controlling influence defined in
       Section 2 (a) (8) by the specified holding companies. Another case of :importance was
       the application filed by Standard Oil Company(NewJersey) for exemption 88 a holding
       companypursuant to paragraph 3 of Section 3 (a).      This application was also denied but
       the operation of the Commission's order was suspended for a period of six .mUls because
       of the problems arisi.ug from the applicant's interest in other businesses and its ex-
       pressed willingness to cooperate with the Commissionin the solving of' its problems
       under the Act. 11/




        V     The 18 bond. issues for which bids were submitted under Rule U-50 included 15 mortgage
              issues of which 2 were bid in by insurance companies, 2 collateral    trust issues, and
              1 Debenture issue.    All of the 16 offerings to the public were rated "bank-qualitytl
              except the Debenture issue.    All were offered within the fiscal year, except the 2
              collateral trust issues which were offered just prior to the commencement    thereof.
              One of the collateral   trust issues (a serial note issue) was also offered with a
              spread of less than one point.

     allocation of taxes between various companies in a holding company system which may
     join in filing a consolidated tax return. ~         There was also a change, largely of an
     administrative   character, in the Commission s Rules governing solicitation       of security
     holders I authorizations   regarding miscellaneous financial transactions.       Under the
     amended rules, solicitations     regarding a transaction which is itself    the subject of
     Commission regulation are scrutinized in connection with the examination of other as-
     pects of the proposed transaction.       In cases where the solicitation   is not part of a
     transaction   subject to regulation (for example, solicitations      in connection with an
     election of directors) ~ the same rules are made applicable as have been adopted pursu-
     ant to the Securities Exchange Act for solicitation      of proxies in respect of securities
     registered on a national securities      exchange.  !11
          A number of minor changes were made by way of simplification          and clarification

      There have been no significant    changes in the past fiscal. year in the policies
or practices  of the COIIIIII:issiOl1
                                   in performing its tunctiOllS UDder Chapter X. which have
been described in previous ammal. reports.        However. four years of experience by' the
Commission. the f'ederal courts and the reorganisation      bar with the operation of
Chapter X have reduced the 8IIlOl1I1t of time required to be spent on purely procedural.
questions, and have permitted greater concentration of the CCllllllission's energies upon
substantive matters.    There now exl.sts a substantial. mDIber of precedents on nearly all
important procedural and interpretive      questions.

                              Plans Of' Reorganisation       Under Chapter X

       The Camnission' s most important function under Chapter :x is to aid the courts in
effecting                 of a f'air aDd feasibl.e plan of reorgazdzation.

of experience there has been S<D8 change in the nature of the problems with which the
Camnission has to deal..

       With respect to the f'a.irness of pl.ans, certain basic 1egal princip1ell urged by' the
Camnission throughout its activities     under Chapter :x are now fiI;establi8hed       as a
resul.t of the Supreme Court decisions in the Los Angeles LUIIber3 and Consolidated Rock

                                                             s Chapter X work during the
fiscal year has been the increased importance and difficUlty of problems of feasibility
including such questions as the adequacy of working capital." the relationship of funded
debt or capital structure to property values, the adequacyof corporate earning power
in 'relation to interest and dividend charges" the effect of proposed new capital..isation
upon the c~'s        prospective credit, and the desirable objective that new securities
shaJ.l not by their terms or otherwise be deceptive to subsequent purchasers. Parties
are inclined to gear their proposed capital structures to inflated ~ earnings, either
because they do not recognize the extent to which the earnings are inflq.ted or because
they hope that the abnormalearnings lfill continue long enoughto permit scaling down
of debt to manageableprOPortions. The element of tax liability is an added force in
the direction of excessive debt structures which provide interest deductions and SCIlla-
times other tax advantages which assumeadded importance :in a period of high tax rates.

      Although security holders' representatives f'requent1:yregard the fairness of the
plan as their principal. concern" the f'ull protection of their interests requires al.so
that the plan be feasible 80 that it will not hamperfuture operations or c<lllpEll another
reorganization. The extent to which the difficulties of debtors now in reorganization
are attributable to previous non-feasible plans is apparent fran an examination of the
34 cases in lIhich a notice of appearance was filed by the CamJlissionduring the fiscal.
year.. 17 iDvolved caupanies lIhich had already undergonereorganization since 1930, most
of them under Section 77Bsince 1935. The Commission'sinsistence that plans shouJ.d
canp1:ywith reasonable standards of feasibility is designed to avoid a similar record
as to Chapter X cases five or ten years hence and its continuing efforts in this reSPect
constitute probab1:ythe most important phase of its present activities in connection
with plans.

                       Advisory Reports on Plans Of Reorganization

      During th~ fiscal year the Commissionprepared formal advisory reports with respect

In Dana v. Securities and Exchanft Commission      71 the Circuit Court of Appeals tor the
SecOiid'Circu1t sustiiiie<i the pOS1on consistently taken by the CCIIIIlissionthat a
formal order of intervention is unnecessary to permit camnittees representing security
holders !io participate   f'ully in proceedings under Chapter X. In re Marine Harbor
Propertieh    Inc. involved the question of good faith in filing a petitIon hi a debtor
the property or Which was subject to a certificated      mortgage which had been reorganised
in the NewYork State Courts pursuant to the provisions of the Shackno Act (NewYork
Laws of 1933" C. 745) and the Mortgage Camnission Act (NewYork Laws of 1935" C. 19).
The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District court's order approving the debtor's
petition.    Certiorari was granted by the Supreme Court, which upheld the CCIIIIlission's
contention that the debtor I s participation   in state court proceedings under the Shackno
and Mortgage CommissionActs did not bar later resort to a proceeding under Chapter X"
but affirmed the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals upon the ground that the
debtor had not sustained the burden of establishing its need for relief under Chapter X
(Section 130) and the existence of good faith in fUing the petition (Section 146).      y
In re Paloma Estates     Inc. 91 raised similar questions.    Sims v. Fidelity Assurance
                         i
ASsociation 10/ fiivo~ved the question whether the debtor was--aniriBurance compaDiY
eligible 'to me a petition under the Bankruptcy Act and questions as to whether the
debtor's petition had bean filed in good faith.       The Ccmnission urged approval of the
debtor's petition and its position was sustained by the District Court. However, upon
appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed" holding that the debtor was an insurance
companynot eligible to seek relief under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act and that
the petition,had    not been filed in good faith because the interests of creditors would
be best subserved in the receivership proceeding pending in West Virginia and other
states.    Certiorari was granted by the United States Supreme Court which, without de-
ciding 'Whether the debtor was an insurance company"concluded ill that the petition had
not been filed in good faith upon the ground stated by the CirCUit Court of Appeals and
upon the additional ground that it was unreasonable to expect that a plan of reorgani-
zation could be effected.

                               ADYINISmATION OF '!HE '!'RUSTINDENTUREACT OF 1939

            Informat!.on regarding the genera1 purpose and scope of the requirements of the Trust
      Indenture Act of 1939, and the Commission's procedure in examining applications for
      qualification   of indentures end trustee statements of eligiblli ty and qualification for
      compliance with the statute,   was set forth in the Sixth Annual Report of the Commission,
      pp. 133-135, inclusive.

            Since then a rule has been adopted       11
                                                   permitting a prospective trustee to obtain a
      declaratory rnllng of the COIIIIII1ssion
                                             as to whether or not it is an affUiate   of a
      specified underwriter.   '!his procedure is to enable complex questions of conflicting
      interests  to be tried and decided in advance of any particular  security issue, to avoid
      delaying seeur1ties transactions when they arise.

            Under this rule J. P. Morgan& Co. Incorporated, a trust company, applied for a
      ruling as to its status in relation to Morgan Stanl.ey & Co. Incorporated, an underwriting
      firm. '!he CoDB1ssionheld that the two houses were under cOJlDllOncontrol within the
      meaning ot 'the Act, and that J. P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated was therefore ineligible  to
      act 88 trustee of securities  issued by any companyfor which Morgan Stanley & Co. Incor-
      porated 1f88 an underwriter.      ?J

                        ADlITNISTRATION OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940

          The. past fiscal year markedthe first full fi8Cal year in the adm1 n1 stration of the
I,
     Inve;:-,tlllent
                   CompanyAct of 1940. During the year the CODJDissionconcerned itself pr~
     with (1) the registration of companiessubject to the Act; (2) the disposition of appli-
     cations filed pursuant to the provisions of the Act seeking a determination of whether or
     not. certain companiesare investment companieswithin the meaningof the Act and appli-
     cations requesting exemption from specific provisions of the Act; (.3) the promulgation of
     rules prescribing the type of information and periodic reports to be filed with the Com-
     mission and the type of information and reports required to be transmitted to security
     holders; and (4) the disposition of general admin1 strative pE"Oblemsarising under the
     various sections of the Act.
                                 Registration of Investllent CQRpenies
           The first step in the reguJ.ation of investment cODlp8D1es      provided by the Investment
     Compan:y  Act of 1940 is the requirement that all investment companieslIllat register with
     the Commission. Registration is acocmplished by filing a simple notification of registra-
     tion with the Commissionpursuant to Section 8 (a) of the Act. Kost companiesregistered
     UDder the Act during the fiscal year ended.June .30, 1941. However,17 com.pa.lnes        fUed
     notifications of registration during the past fiscal;rear.          Two of these 17 companieswere
     organized ciur:f.Jlg t.he fiscal ,ear and t.he others bad not. registered previously, either be-
     cause they claimed an exemption frOJll the provisions of the Act.or for someother reason.

           The next step in the registration process involves the filing wit.b th~ Conmissionby
     every registered investment companyof a detailed registration statement pursuant to Sec-
     tion 8 (b) of the Act. These registration statement.s are filed in accordance with ruJ.es,
     regul.ations and forms promulgated by the Commissionwhich are specifically designed for
     investment companies.

          In addition to FormN-8B-l, which relates to managementcompanies and was promulga'tied
     during the fiscal year ended June .30, 1941, the Commissionhas promulgated two new forms
     to be used for filing detailed registration statement.s. These forms are designated Form
     N-8B-2and FormN-8:?-.3. FormN-8B-2is designed for use by unit investment trusts which
     are currently issuing securities, and FormN-8B-.3is designed for uee by unincorporated
     managementcompaniescurrently issuing periodic pa;ymentplan certificates.
           The detailed registration statements contain comple'tieinformation regarding each
     company,including certified financial statements, information regarding 'the organization
     of the comp8ll1',managementpersonnel and affiliated persons, compensation to o1"1"icers,
     directors and certain employees, capital structure, nature of asse~s, distribution and
     redemption of securities, information regarding the trustee and sponsor of the compaIlY and
                                               with respect to certain speci1'ied subjects.
     a recital of the policies of the cOIIlp8.Dy'

           In connection with the adoption of forms to be used for filing registration statements
     under the Investment COIIIp8ll1'
                                   Act, the Commissionalso adopted rules which permit invest-
     ment campanies to file copies of information a1re~ filed under other Acts administ9J:'ed
     by" the CClIDIII1sSion
                        in lieu of registration statements under the Investment CClIIlpa.DY'
                                                                                         Act, and
     thereb7 gave effect to the d1recti ve of the Congress a8 set. forth in Section 8 (c) of thE'
     Act.. These rules are designed to facW.tat8 registration by ccapanies which are subject
     to one ar more or the other Acts adm1 n1 stered by the COJIIII1ssion.Several companieshave
     availed themselves of the privilege accorded b:r t.hese rules. -

           Two hundred forty-five registered investment companies fil~~ detailed registration
     st.atements under 'the Act during the past fiscal year. Of these 245 registration st.ate-
     ments, 89 were filed by managementopen-end diversified companies, 8 by managementopen-
     end non-diversified companies, 62 by managementclosed-end diversified companies, 76 by
     managementclosed-end. non-diversified companies, and 10 by unit investment trusts.
                                                 - 33 -
     Every registration     statement filed   under the Act is carefully   examined   by   the Com-
mission's staff.

                 Periodic    Reports to the Commissionand to Security Holders

      Section 30 (a)   of the Investment CompanyAct provides that registered investment
companies must file with the Commission such information, documents and reports as com-
panies having securities   registere~ on a national sec~rities exchange are required to tile
with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 (a) of the Securities Exchange Ac~ 9f 1934.
Section 30 (b) of the Investment CompanyAct authorizes the Commission to require regis-
tered investment companies to file reports on a semi-annual or quarterly basis so as to
keep reasona~ly current the information contained in th~ registration   statements of such
companies. The Commission promulgated two periodic report forms applicable to manag8lll8Dt
investment companies during the past fiscal year. The periodic report forms for the other
classes of investment companies had not been promulgated at the close of the fiscal year.

      All registered managementinvestment companies which filed detailed registration
statements on Form N-8B-1 are required to file annual reports on Form N-JOA-l within 120
days after the close of- each fiscal year.   '!be annual report form is designed to bx"ing
up to date as of the close of each fiscal year of the registrant,      the information
originally furnished by the registrant  in its detailed registration    statement.   Form
N-30A-l is designed for use under both the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Invest-
ment CompanyAct of 1940, and duplicate filings under these Acts are thereby eliminated.

     All registered managementinvestment companies which filed detailed registration    state-
ments on Form N-8B-l are required to file quarterly reports on Form N-30B-l within .30 dqs
after t.he close of each fiscal quarter.   The quarterly report form requires only the minimum
information necessar)" to be kept current to aid the Commissionin the admin; stration of the
Act. This form is also designed for use under both the Securities :bbtchangeAct of 1934 and
the Investment CompanyAct of 1940, and supplants Form 8-K, the current report form under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, insofar as it is applicable to managementinvestment
companies having securities   listed and registered on a national securities  exchange.

     One hundred ninety-six companies filed annual reports        on Form N-30A-l during the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1942 and a like number filed quarterly        reports on Fora N-30B-1.

      Section 30 (d) of the Act provides that every registered investment COlllpany' shall
transmit    to its stockholders, and file with the Commission, at least semi-annually,
reports containing certain prescribed information and financial statements.    Doring the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1942, 633 periodic reports to security holders 1P3refiled with
the Commission.

                            !pplications   for Exemptions or Exceptions

      A lications under Section 3 (b) (2) of the Act. A cOlll~ which comes within the
quantitative   definition 0 an investment eoapan    as contained in Section 3 (aJ (3) of
the Act may apply to the Commission for an order pursuant to Section 3 (b) (2) ~f the Act,
declaring it to be primari1yengaged in a business other than that of an investment company.
Such other business may be conducted either directly or through majority-owned subsidiaries
or controlled companies conducting similar types of businesses.    During the past fiscal ~ar
two such applications were denied, two other applications were denied under Section 3 (b)
(2) although exemptions were granted under other sections of' the Act, and four such appli-
cations were withdrawn. The Commission granted five applications pursuant to this section
during the fiscal year, and at June 30, 1942, fourteen applications were pending.

     other Applications for Exemptions. Section 6 (c) of the Act confers upon the Com-
mission general exemptive powers if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or
appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and
the pUrposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this title.

               ADI1INISTRATION OF THE INVESTl'1ENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940

                                 Registration     Statistics

      As of June 30, 1941.there were registered with the Commissionpursuant to the pro-
visions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 753 investment advisers, consisting of
~O sole proprietors,   123 partnerships and 210 corporations. On June 30, 1942 there
were 732 registered investment advisers consisting of 4ll sole proprietors, 123 part-
nerships and 19S corporations.

       The following table sets forth information with respect to the status   of the re~-

      In order to maintain reasonably current the information contained in the appli-
cations for registration,   the Commissionrequires semi-annual reports to be filed by
all registered investment advisers.    These reports must be filed with the Commission
within ten days after June 30Jand December31, of each year.       Each registered invest-
ment adviser is required to disclose in the semi-annu8.l.report that after an examina-
tion of his original application for registration    he finds either that (1) no changes
have been effected in his business 50 that no amendmentsare required to the applica-
tion for registration   or (2) that changes have been effected in his business so tha~
amendmentsare necessary for certain items in the original application for registra-
tion.    If changes have been effected in business, amendmentsto the items affected
arc: included in the semi-annual report.

      Section 203 (d) of the Act empowersthe Commissionto deny, revoke or suspend
the registration  of an investment adviser if certain conditions exist.     One of the
grounds for denying, revoking or suspending the registration    of an investment a~ser
is the fact that such investment adviser within ten years prior to the registration
has been convicted of a crime in connection with securi. ties transactions or has been
enjoined by a court from acting as an investment adviser, undeiwriter, broker or
dealer.

      In the exercise of its power under this section, the Commissionhas revoked the
registration  of one investment adviser.   In this case it was found that the investment
adviser in question had been enjoined by an order of the United States Distri ct Court
from engaging in certain conduct and practices in connection with the purchase and
sale of securities.   In addition to this it was found that the application for regis-
tration contained material misstatements.    It was also found that the investment ad-
viser in question had converted to his o.m benefit certain moneys sent to him by
clients for the purchase of securities,   that he had purchased .securities contrary to
the authority of his clients and had converted the re"'laining balances to his 0I'm use.

        Absence 01" 'Power to Inspect Books and Records of Inyestment Advisers

     Section 209 (a) of the Act provides that whenever it appears to the Canmission
that the provisions of this Act have been or are about to be violated the Commission
                                           -36-
can institute   a fo:nnal.investigation for the purpose or determining whether there has
been or is ".bout to be a violation of the Act. The Act# however#does not confer upon
the Commission the authority or duty to makeperiodic inspections of the accounts and
records of registered investment advisers such as is conferred upon the Commission by
Section 17 (a) of the Securities ExchangeAct of 19.34with respect to registered
broker-dealers. This anission leaves entirely unsupervised and unprotected a broad
field in the handling of investment flmds of the general public. Unfortunate situations
involving large losses to clients have occurred which might have been averted if the
Camnissionhad authority to makeregular periodic inspections of the accounts of reg-
istered investment advisers. The details or these situations and a further report to
the Congresswill be madeconcerning this matter.

        "subscription  cards" and other instruments solicited   fran the members in connection
        with the "personlll loans.-

              In the case of securities  and Eltchange Caamission v. S. W. Funk,     the Oaamia- 21
        sion filed a complaili£ to eJijoin the we or prorit=Sharing    agreements relating  to oU
        and gas leases.   The proceeds fran the sale of these securities,   which the defendants
        tenned ftmutual escrow agreements, n were used to finance the drl1J ing of a test well
        within the area embraced by the leases.

             In the first civU case involving Section 12 (h) of the Public Utility Holding
        Company Act, pertaining to political contributions,   the Camnission obtained a consent
        judgment enjoining Utah Power & Light ComP8l11" from further violating that section.                   y

               Be'tween Me,y 15 and June 6. 1942. several of the largest hoJ.diDg caJIP8llYsystems in

        sented the first major challenge of the constitutionality           01 the H01cling Com~      Act
        since the original. fiood of litigation        during the early' days of that statute,   lIhich
        terminated when the 8upl'eme Court su1Jtained the constitutionality         of the registration
        provisions in Electric Bond and Share Co. v. securities           and Exchange Commission, 305
        U. S. 419 (1938).      ttter   the ciose or the fiscal year the Second CircUit             of court
        Appeal.s af'finned the CClllldssionI s integration     order against The North American can-

        but have complied with, or are in the process of complying with, COIIIldssion orders
        under the integration       and simplification   sections.

              Another group of cases during the year involved petitions   to review Canmission
        orders d~       app1ications by public utUity   companies to be declared not subsidi-

.After the close of the fiscal year the Supreme Court of the United states aff1med the.

                                    Crimi nal Proceedings

      ~e statutes administered by the COIIIII11ssionprovide that evideDce ot violations
may' be transnitted to the Attorney General, who, in his discretion, -.;q institute
criminal proceedings.    It is the policy or the CClllllissionto make a thorough investi-
gation of alleged violations of the Acts and to consider caretully whether the evi-
dence obtained merits criminal prosecution.     If violations of the penal provisions are
indicated, the results of such investigation    and the supporting erldence are referred
to the Department of Justice.    Thereafter, if criminal proceedings are insti1iuted, the
members ot the CommissionI s staff who participated   in the investigation  assist the
United States Attorneys in the preparation of the cases tor presentation to the grand
jury, in the trials whi~h follow, and in the preparation of appellate briefs.

     Where evidence does not warrant prosecution under the Acts admin1 stered by the
Commission, but violations ot other statutes are indicated, the evidence is subnitted
to the appropriate state or federal agency. This results in the reference of quite a
few cases to the postal authorities, to state commissions or other local en1"orcement
authorities.

                   Up to July 1" 1942" the Commission had caused to be instituted proceedings against
             19 defendants .for criminal contempt of court orders which had been obtained by the Commis-
             sion.  Of this number 13 were .found guilty.  One of these cases is now awaiting decision
             by the court.

                   A brief description of the criminal cases pending during the year ended June 30~ 1942,
             showing their status on that date, is set forth in Appendix Tables 23, 24 and 27. A brief
             discussion of saDe of the 1IIOreimportant cases follows:

                  SECURITIES  ACTOF 1933.-Schemes to defraUd uncovered in the en.torcement of this Act
             are ot iDfiiiIte varIetj'. Prosecutions during the year involved a 1arge-scal.e cemetery
             pranotion in lIaine (U. S. v. Paul F. Cassidy et al); a pecan orchard enterprise in Southern
     ,   .
                                                -41-
    Louisiana (U. S. v. R. B. Broury et ano.); a popcorn vending maebine<DJJ.P8ZlY     in Ohio
    (u, s. v. F. E. Backmeier et a:1 ; an automotive patent venture in Los Ange~e8 (u. S. v.
    O~LundenU8         et ano.); an oil and gas lease promotion covering land in Texas'""'iiiir
    Malians. (U. S. v. H. R. Edwards); a mining canp~ in Colorado (U. S. v. Amos Do1m8 et
    al); and aii""'Iiiaustria:I pi&tit In Carrollton, Ohio (U. S. v. Z. A. GiI'Sirt et 81). EV8ii
    TEe religious beliefs and social proclivities      of prospective iIivestors have been utU-
    ized as a basis for promotional ventures which were made the subject of prosecution.
    For example, there is the Uriversal Order of P1enocrats in Chicago (n. S. v. C. F. Darts
    et al); and the Mantle Club, centering in Wi1lIIingtonand fanning out-a!I"""over the country
    (U. S. v. H. B. Monjar at al).

          Many of these cases involved nation-ride      solicitation  of investments.       Brti:P
                                                                                        In the
    case, in which convictions were obtained in Oklahomaand five-year prison sentences
    posed, more than $700,000 had been obtained by the defendants from about 1,400 investors
    residing in many different     states.    In the MOnt;ar case, involving the Mantle C~ub, a
    socio-fraternal   organization,    investments had     en obtained from people residing from
    Baltimore, Maryland to Portland, Oregon. In the Downs case, the stock of a mining CeD-
    pany was sold in almost evwy state of the Union,a:B'Well as in the District of Columbia
    and "in Canada. The defendants were tried and convicted in federal court at Denver.

         T he current prosecutions ane.iuded a number invo~ving efforts to evade the prov1s1QD8
    of the securities    laws by casting the enterprise into a form calculated to appear to be
    something other than an investment in securities    as defined by the Act. For example, in
    the Broom case it was made to appear that the investors were purchasing pecan orchard
    acreage; an the Backmeier case that they were purchasing vending machines; in the Davis
    case 'tn8't 'they were sUbscribing to membersh1.ps10 a <UrtneJ.y inSpired farm prOgram; aDCl
    in the Monjar case that they were contributing to some transcendental program tor the
    moral, as well. as the financial,   benefit of the members of the Mantle Club.

        Also during the fiscal year a large number of convictions obtained in similar case8
  were affirmed by the appellate courts.       These included the affirmance of convictions 1n
  Seattle for fraud in the sale of oil and gas leases (J. F. S:i:monset a1 v. U. S.); con-
  victions in Denver for fraud in the sale of stock of a cement comp~ (E. s:-Gites v.
  U. S.; C. S. Rice v. U. S.); a conviction in Detroit for fraud in the ~aIe        or   stock of a
  comp-any matCiiigbeer barrels (J. K. Edlin v. U. S.); convictions in California for the
  sale of oil leases, and interests     therein, onproperties   in California CA. Atherton et al
  v. U. S.); a conviction for fraud in the sale of notes and trade acceptances           iSm    hi a
  whiskey rectifying    company in Florida (A. F. Fisher v. U. S.); a conviction for fraudu-
  lent sale of securities     of a mortgage company in Nebraski'l't.   S. Holmes v. U. S~); a con-
  viction in NewMexico for the sale of stock in an insurance shares corporatIOii"TS. C.
  Pandolfo v. U. S.); and the conviction in NewYork of a certified          public accountiii:E""?or
  complicity ~         fraudulent sale of stock of an industrial     service canp~    (ll. H. White
: v. U. S.).   In many of these cases onl.v a few of the defendants appealed.        In 811 of these
: cases 'the cunvic'tions were affirmed trr 'the appella'te courts.

        SECURITIES  EXCHANGEACTOF 1934. Of the more outstanding of 'tne prosecutions duri.ng
. the past year Which arose from investigations     under the 1934 Act, three :involved stock
: market manipulations.   In U. S. v. Ery KehO!ket ale convictions were obtained in NewYork
; on charges of manipulating-nitlNew York Stoc EXChange market for the commonstock of
. Standard Commercial Tobacco Companyin order to permit the defendants to unload large
; blocks of the stock upon the unsuspecting public investors.         It was charged that this 'W8S
: accanplished by means of the well mown manipulative devices of wash sales, matched orders,
, and "touting" of the stock.    Similar Ill8I1:ipulative activity,  this time on a regional stock
. exchange, was :involved in U. S. v. R~ond R. T~             where a prison sentence of approxi-
1 mately two years was impose<IOil TaylOFfor violS! ona involving the market on the Detroit
  Stock Exchange for stock of Mid-West Abrasive Com:pany. In U. S. v. David Smart et           aJ..,
, the manipulation involved a well     mown publishing concern, E8<iUIre-coronet,    me.    C<mv1e-
, tiona 1'1ereobtained in Chicago against executives of the publishing concern and securities
                                              -42-
brokers of If... York City, all of whomwere charged with conspiring to raise artificiall.y the
price of the cClllpany'sstock on the NewYork Curb Exchangein order to unload at the manipu-
lated prices 200,000 shares of stock belonging to two of the defendants.
     Another extremel3' important case which arose under the 1934 Act was that of ~.     v.
Russell W. McDermott,a securities broker of Indianapolis, whowas convicted of violations
of the margin rUles, fraud in over-the-counter transactions in securities with his own
customers, and fraud perpetrated by means of excessive trading in a discretionar;y account.
During the ;year the conviction of G. A. Gantz, a securities broker of St. Louis, on charges
1Ib1chinvolved operation of bis blleiness 1Ibile insolvent and unauthorized 118e of customers'
money, was affirmed b;y the Circuit Court; of Appea1s.
       OTHER ACTS. Convictions were obtained during the year against UnionEl.ectric Com~
of Jl1~m      on charges of maJdngpolitical. contributions, madeun1aIrf'ul. by Section 12 (b)
of the Public Utility Holding ComP8lV' Act of 1935. Louis H. Egan, former president of the
cClllp8DT,W'&8 found guiltY' of conspiracy to violate the same section, which makesit unlaIr-
tu1 for a holding coBrp&l\1  or subsidiary thereof to make political. contriwtions.   '!be com-
p8II1' wsa fined 180,000 and Eganwas 8EI1tencedto two years' imprisonment, in addition to
a fine of 110,000. UnionElectric ~            is a subsidiary of '!be North AmericanCanpany.
'!'he 1Dd1ctlleDtcharged the defendants with setting up a "slush fond" acCumul.atedthrough
kick-bBcka from legal. fees, pqaents to contractors and insurance agents, and the padding
of expense accounts.                                                                              I-



     The cCll1T.l.ction
                     of F);-ank J. Boehm, former vice president of Union Electric Company,on !.
dharges of perjury"was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, and the SupremeCourt
denied certiorari.   The conviction was based upon perjury cqmmitted by Boehm while testi-
fJ1ng before officers of the Coaaission in an investigation involving alleged violations of c
the anti-political. contribution section of the 1935 Act.                                    l~
     '!'be appeal. of HowardG. Hopson, former president of the Associated Gas & Electric Com-;)
pany, was dismissed during the past year. He had been convictad of fraud in connection      .~
with the operation of the huge Associated Gas & Electric System.
      An indictment was returned against one of the largest of the investment companiesfor ;(
an alleged fraud in the sale of 215,000 investment certificates in the face amountof          ;'
$600,000,000 through an organization which extended into at least twenty-nine states.     The ~
indictment alleged that the defendants made.use of deceptive financial statements, con-
cealed artificial. -.rite-ups of securities values, manipUlatedtrust funds, engaged in
stock market manip1l.ation, and operated while insolvent.    The indictment was returned in
Detroit.   (~.     v; Fidelity Investment Association et al.)

      An appeal during the year involved charges of defrauding an investment comp~ by a
controlling person, Wallace Groves, 'Whoseconviction 'Wasaffirmed by the SecondCircuit
Court of Appeals. The indictment had charged him. with defrauding the General Investment
CclmpaD;r in connection with sales to it of its own securities and paymentof fictitious
ca.missions on transactions pretended to be beneficial to the company. The conviction of
George S. Groves was reversed. The SupremeCourt denied certiorari to Wallace Groves.

the Commission has compiled a very extensive Securities Vio1.ations File which serves as a
clearing house for information which is made available to those officials   and agencies
direct1y concerned with the eradication of illegal practices in the securities field.    As
of June 30, 1942, the Conmission had assembled data concerning 41.,065 persons and. corpo-
rations against whom. State or Fe_dera1action has been taken in connection with the sale of
securities.   During the past fiscal year approximately 5,170 items of info~tlon    per-

                            INTERPRETATIVE   AND ADVISORY SERVICE

      The Commission bas always recognized that the technical nature of the statutes it
adm; ni sters requires an interpretati va and advisory service by the Commissionto pro-
vide attorneys and the general public with prompt advice concerning problems arising
under these statutes.

      Inquiries   are handled. by correspondence as well as personal   and telephone
cont'erences •

       The jtn"isdiction ot the Commissiondoes not extend to private disputes of a civil
nature arising under the securities     laws. Therefore, the Commission cannot advise
litigants    concerning the prosecution or defense in such cases. Where a civil suit be-
tween private parties has involved a disputed question of law under the Acts admin-
istered by the Commission, however, the Commission has on occasion tiled a brief with
the court as amicus curiae in order to advise the court of its interpretation    of the
law as the agency administering it.

         A.CTIVITIES   OF THE COMMISSION IN THE FIELD OF ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING
                                    i




                                  Eftect   of the War Etfort

      During the past year, accountants have been faced with many new and serious prob-
lems arising from the war effort and the earlier Nati\mal Defense program. The Com-
mission likewise, because of the importance which it attaches to financial statements,
has had to give caref'ul consideration to these problems and to the need f'or all
appropriate adjustments.

      The Commission, in commonwith the accounting profession,   has oeen especially" in-
terested in the maintenance of appropriate auditing standards.    Fortunately, all con-
cerned are agreed that the high standards of present practice should not be foregone.
A principal difficulty  has been the loss by most public accounting firms of' much
trained personnel to other phases of the war effort.    Furthermore, a similar loss of
accounting personnel by private business, coupled, in many instances, with a large new
volume of war work, has meant that internal accounting and auditing controls, upon
which the public accountant must rely in many respects, have in many instances suf-
fered. and hence, with a smaller or less experienced starf,  the public accountant is
otten faced with the necessity of being even more painstaking in his audit.

      Members ot the Commission's staft have cooperated with registrants       and public ac-
 countants in exploring 'Various means of meeting the situation.       As a result, regis-
trants have been encouraged to change their fiscal periods trClll a calendar year to a
"natural business" year in an eftort to lessen the year-end burden so as to utilize
the public accountant's services more etticiently.       In A.ccounting Series Release No• .30,
the CaIm1ssion outlined a special procedure and "1IIethodot disclosure to be tollowed
by registrants   and their accountants where the press ot war production prevented nor-
mal inventor,y-tak1ng.   It has also been indicated that lack at personnel could provide
a proper basis tor requesting an extension       or
                                                 tiJlle tor til1Dg amnaJ reports with this
OCIB1ssion. Study' ot these problems is being cont~           and informal conferences are
held as occasion warrants with individual accountants and with the appropriate caam1t-
tees ot professi~      societies.

       The ('.anmission has also cooperate4 with various Federal war agencies through   c0n-
sultation   and through utilisation   of its expert help for specialized work.

                          Cooperation with Professional    Societies

     The CoIaission has sought to cooperate with the accounting profession and to add
its tull influence to :that of the professional societies and others in a joint efrort
to maintain and raise accounting aDd auditing standards.   As heretorore,  the Gamlis-
sian, in its praaul.gation ot mles or opinions on accounting atters,    has, wherever
                                             - 45 -
practicable" invited the ecements or suggestions of other Federal and State agencies
interested in accounting, of committees of professional societies, and of other in-
terested persons • Reciprocally, the Camnission has been invited to offer suggestions
or commentson proposed actions or bulletins of these organizations.   The past year
has produced much Bratifying evidence as to the effectiveness of these activities.

                                       Professional   Conduct

      While the Commissionhas cooperated with the accounting profession to secure a
commonobjective of high professional standards, yet it has, as it must, reserved to
itself the right to invoke sanctions against accountants who wilfully or carelessly
violate its rules.   During the past year the Commissionfor the first time found it
necessary to invoke against an accountant the sanctions found in Rule II (e) of its
Rules of Practice.   In In the Matter of AbrahamH. Puder, et al.          W,
                                                                       the Commission,
on the basis of stipulated facts, issued an order suspending Puder and the firm of
Puder and Puder from practice before the Commissionfor three months. In In the r1at-
tar of Kenneth N. Logan    W, the accountant was denied the right to practice before
the Commissionfor sixty days.

                                  Accountin:; and Auditing

      Several opinions involving accounting or auditinG matters were issued by the
Commissionduring the year. Of these, the case of outstanding significance was In the
T:atter of Associated Gas and ~lectric Comoa          W,
                                                     a delisting proceeding under Sec-
tion 19 a     2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The findings and opinion in
this case contain an extensive criticism of various accounting practices followed in
the financial statements of the registrant and of certain aspects of the certificates
furnished by Haskins & Sells.

      Other opinions under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 dealt with the independence of the certifying accountant W'; the adequacy of
the representations  made in an accountant's certificate        W;
                                                               and the failure of fi-
nancial statements to conform to sound accounting principles.?:Q/    In addition, many
of the findings and opinions under other Acts administered by the Commission,partic-
ularly the Public utility  Holding CompanyAct of 1935, included discussion and decision
of varied accounting issues.

factory financial statements for investors.       Also, accounting am auditing problems
have been the subject     of innumerable informal conferences betw.een the Commission's
staff and representatives    of particular  registrants.    These conferences have proved to
be an expeditious means of resolving difficult      or unusual questions with respect to
which no specific rules have been issued or the application of existing rules is
uncertain.

      The Congress, three times, bas in effect directed the COIIIIlissionto adopt rules
governing the solic! tation or proxies. 1J/ The C~ssion'    s proxy rules, which' are
contained in Regulation X-14, require certain information to be made available +.e
security holders whose proxies, consents or authorization  are solicited.

      During the fiscal year the Commission examined both the preliminary and final
proxy material with respect to 1,655 solicitations      and in each case commentedon the
material to the persons making the solicitation.      In many cases it ~ed       revised
drafts of prelimin.ary material.    Aside from. the initial  material, 333 pieces ot: sup-
plemental or "follow-up" soliciting    material   were received and examined.. In addi-
tion to the regular examination which is made of all proxy material filed, the Camnis-
sion continued its policy of furnishing every ass.istance to persons who desired to ob-
tain intonnal opinions or suggestions in advance of the filing date.

     Under the various Acts it is the Commission's duty to publish its decisions and
generally to inform Congress and the public of its activities.      Its releases are classi-
fied into various categories so that a person may receive the material relating only to
those phases of the COJIIIIission's work in which he is interested.    The Ccmd.ssian has made
an exhaustive check ot its mailing lists to elim..lnate those no longer desiring specified.
