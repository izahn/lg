            IMPORTANT RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Recent Market Trends
   Between 1964 and 1968, the securities industry experienced an
enormous and largely unanticipated increase in the volume of trad-
ing, with annual share volume on all registered stock exchanges ris-
ing from 2 to 5.3 billion shares. Since then, however, trading has
subsided and volume during the first half of 1970 was down 18 per-
cent from the comparable 1968 period. The reduced trading volume
has been accompanied by substantial declines in stock prices and in
the number of new issues offered for distribution. There has also
been since 1964 a significant change in trading patterns, character-
ized by an increased participation by financial institutions in equity
markets and a proportionately decreased participation by individual
investors. Block transactions, or trades involving a large number of
shares, have increased along with the rise in institutional activity.
   The rapid growth in trading in the mid-1960's caused serious op-
erational problems throughout the brokerage industry. To cope with
these back-office problems, many firms made substantial investments
in automated equipment and hired new employees. These expendi-
tures and a general inflation in operational costs accentuated the loss
of revenue that accompanied the decline in stock prices and trading
volume in 1969 and 1970. The rather extensive losses incurred hy
many broker-dealers forced some firms into bankruptcy or liquida-
tion and a number of others have merged in an attempt to improve
their financial condition and operations.
   Much of the Commission's time and attention has been devoted to
the problems created by these recent market developments. For ex-
ample, the Commission has conducted extensive hearings concerning
the commission rate structure and has participated in drafting
legislation to provide increased protection against broker-dealer in-
solvency. The Commission has also been developing procedures to
accommodate the new automated trading systems and improved clear-
ing procedures being introduced in the securities industry. Many of
these activities are described in greater detail in the following sec-
tions of this Report.

Operating and Financial Condition of Broker-Dealer Firms
   The "back office" problems which beset the securities industry in
1969/ while still not completely resolved, have been overshadowed
during the past year by the serious financial difficulties experienced
by many firms. In part, the current financial squeeze grew out of ef-
forts to meet the unprecedented trading volume of prior years
through the expansion of firms and the automation of facilities.
Some firms, wishing to take advantage of the increased trading vol-
ume, opened officesin locations which could not in normal times pro-
duce the amount of business needed for profitable operations. Other
firms experienced severe difficulties in attempting to go from manual
record keeping and securities handling procedures to automated sys-
tems. 'Vhen volume on the exchanges and in the over-the-counter
marked dropped, firms were forced to retrench by reducing the num-
ber of branch officesand by cutting back sales and clerical personnel.
Operating losses were widespread throughout the industry, and some
of the larger firms were sustaining large and consistent losses.
   The continuing decline in securities prices in 1970, following that
of 1969, had an adverse effect on the financial condition of broker-
dealers in two ways: first, it contributed to the decline in trading
volume; and second, it diminished the capital of firms both by low-
ering the value of trading and investment positions and by making
it more difficult :for firms to sell restricted securities or large posi-
tions of thinly-traded securities. In view of the declining profit mar-
gins and shrinking security prices, many firms were unable to re-
plenish depletions of capital caused by the death or withdrawal of
partners or by the failure of subordinated lenders to renew their
loans.
   A number of firms have merged in an effort to improve their finan-
cial condition. Other firms have been forced into liquidation be-
cause they could no longer comply with the financial responsibility
requirements of the Commission and the exchanges.
   During the last fiscal year the Commission took action in a num-
ber of cases to enforce compliance with its net capital rule and other
rules designed for the protection of investors' funds and securities.
The net capital rule, which requires that broker-dealers have at least
$1 in net capital for every $20 in aggregate indebtedness, is designed
to assure that firms will maintain enough liquid assets to meet nor-
mal demands from customers for the delivery of their funds and se-
curities. The various measures taken when it appeared that these
rules were being violated included the institution of 45 administra-

    1   See 35th Annual Report, PP. 1-4.
                     TEITRTY-SIKTH ~AL            REPORT                      3
tive proceedings and 29 injunctive actions; the Commission obtained
the appointment of receivers in 21 of the injunctive proceedings.
Certain of the exchanges also took action against their members to
enforce compliance with similar rules, and they forced other firms to
merge or to liquidate their business.
   The New York Stock Exchange made commitments from its Spe-
cial Trust Fund to protect the customers of troubled member firms,
and certain other exchanges with trust funds also acted to assume
responsibility for the obligations of certain of their members who
had become insolvent. However, by the spring of 1970 the amount of
money remaining uncommitted in various exchange trust :funds ap-
peared to be inadequate to do more than indemnify the customers of
those firms which were at that time already in serious financial dif-
ficulty. Consequently, both the Commission and the Administration
engaged in intensive efforts to secure adoption of legislation which
would insure funds and securities of customers of brokerage firms
against future insolvencies much as bank deposits are insured.
Proposed Legislation To Provide Increased Protection Against Broker-Dealer
  Insolvency
   The first legislative proposals for broker-dealer insurance were in-
troduced by Senator Muskie of Maine in June 1969. Congressional
hearings on these and similar legislative proposals were held begin-
ning in April 1970. With the encouragement of the Congressional
committees concerned, the Commission joined with representatives of
the securities industry, the Treasury Department and other govern-
ment agencies to draft revised legislation which would meet certain
objections to the original proposals. A "consensus" bill, which was
submitted in July 1970 to Congressional subcommittees, provided
for the creation of a nonprofit membership corporation, to be known
as Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), to administer
the insurance program. At the date of writing in October 1970, the
appropriate committees of both houses of Congress had approved ver-
sions of the bill and it awaits a floor vote in each house. The versions
approved by the House and Senate Committees differ from the con-
sensus bill as well as from each other. However, the basic program
and the overall plan of implementation, as proposed in the consensus
bill, remain. *
   • A bill embodying this proposed. legislation, H.R. 19333, was passed by the
House on December 1, 1970. The bill, with added. amendments, was passed. by the
Senate on December 10, 1970 and then went to a Conference Committee which
issued a report (H. Rept. No. 91-1788) on December 18, 1970. The Conference
version of the bill was passed by the House on December 21, 1970 and by the
Senate on December 22, 1970. The enrolled bill was signed by the President on
December 30,1970 and is now Public Law 91--598.
4             SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

   Under both bills, all registered broker-dealers and all members of
national securities exchanges would be members of the Corporation
unless exempted. The bills would provide insurance coverage of up to
$50,000 per customer in the event of failure of a broker-dealer. The
insurance program would be funded by the industry, with $1 billion
in standby credit from the United States Treasury. A £und of at
least $75 million, to be raised from the industry by assessments on
its members and by bank lines of credit, would be available within
 120 days of enactment of the legislation. Broker-dealers would be
assessed annually lh of 1 percent of their gross revenues from the
securities business until such time as the fund reached $150 million.
Thereafter, assessments could fall to % of 1 percent until all lines of
credit were phased out. If at any time the fund were to fall below
$100 million, the lh of 1 percent assessment would be reinstated. Se-
curities exchanges would be able to transfer trust funds they main-
tain for the protection of customers of their members to the Corpo-
ration as a credit against future assessments on their members.
   If the fund accumulated by the assessments and bank lines of
credit should prove to be insufficient, the Commission could borrow
up to $1 billion from the Treasury and advance these funds to the
Corporation. As a condition of any such loan, the Commission would
have to certify to the Secretary of the Treasury that the loan is nec-
essary to protect investors and maintain confidence in United States
securities markets and that the Corporation has submitted a plan
providing a reasonable assurance of prompt repayment through the
imposition of additional assessments. The Commission could impose
a transaction fee (up to a specified percentage of the purchase price)
on equity securities purchases of $5,000 or more if necessary to satis-
factorily repay the loan.
   Under the proposed legislation, the existing self-regulatory orga-
nizations would continue to inspect their members for compliance
with "financial responsibility rules" and make such reports on these
inspections as the Corporation might require. The Commission,
moreover, would have additional powers to require any self-regula-
tory organization to (1) alter or supplement rules relating to the
frequency and scope of inspection of the financial condition of its
members, (2) furnish the Corporation and the Commission with re-
ports relating to such financial condition, and (3) inspect members
in relation to their financial condition.
   The legislation would authorize the Corporation to apply to a
court for a decree adjudicating that customers of a broker-dealer
member are in need of protection whenever it appears to the Corpo-
ration that a member has failed or is in danger of failing to meet its
                   THIRTY-SIXTH     ANNUAL REPORT                      5
 obligations to customers. If one or more specified conditions were
 found by the court to exist, an application would have to be granted
 and a trustee appointed to liquidate the broker-dealer. The trustee
  would have the same powers as a trustee in bankruptcy and a trustee
 under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act. He would promptly return
 specifically identifiable property to customers. It is made clear that
 securities held in bulk segregation or as part of a central certificate
 service are to be considered to be specifically identified. In addition,
 the trustee would be required to pay any remaining claims of customers
 up to the $50,000limit with funds advanced by the Corporation and to
 supervise the liquidation and winding up of the broker-dealer.
   The legislation would also amend Section 15(c) (3) of the Securi-
ties Exchange Act of 1934 to extend the coverage of that section to
broker-dealers who do business only on an exchange and to eliminate
certain doubts regarding the Commission's power to provide safe-
guards with respect to the financial responsibility of broker-dealers
to whatever extent the public interest requires, whether by capital
requirement rules or otherwise.
Structure and Level of Commission Rates
   1. History of the Current Proceedings
   In May 1968 the Commission requested the New York Stock Ex-
change to adopt an interim rate structure with a volume discount or,
as an alternative, to eliminate fixed rates of commission for large
transactions. This step was taken to correct apparent inequities in
the rate structure in effect at that time. At the same time, the Com-
mission announced that it would institute public investigatory hear-
ings to consider long-term changes in the stock exchange commission
rate structure and related matters including: (1) commission rate
levels for nonmembers and for members; (2) the services for which
commissions pay and the costs allocated thereto; (3) give-ups and
reciprocal practices among different categories of members and non-
members; (4) membership for financial institutions on exchanges;
 (5) economic access to exchange markets by nonmember broker-
dealers; (6) competition among exchanges and other markets; and
 (7) access of exchange members to the third market. These hearings
were begun in July 1968.
   In August 1968 the New York Stock Exchange submitted to the
Commission a proposal to amend its constitution and rules to pro-
vide for reductions in (i) minimum commission rates paid by non-
members on that portion of orders which involve more than 1,000
shares and in (ii) intra-member commission rates, and (iii) to pro-
hibit the so-called "customer-directed give-up." This proposal was
approved by the Commission pending completion of the hearings
6              SECURITIES    AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

 and the development of long-term solutions. A new schedule under
 the interim plan became effective December 5, 1968.2
    In September 1968, the New York Stock Exchange contracted to
 have National Economic Research Associates (NERA), an economic
 consulting firm, undertake such research as it deemed necessary for
 the purpose of proposing a revised schedule of commission rates.
 The premises and methodology of this study and, later, its results
 were considered by the Exchange's Costs and Revenues Committee.
 The completed study provided a basis for the proposed new mini-
 mum commission rate schedule presented by the Exchange to the
 Commission on June 30, 1970. According to the Exchange, the
 schedule was keyed to industry costs and was designed to meet rela-
 tively long-term financial requirements of the industry. In addition, the
 Exchange proposed a review of rates every 2 years-and             as fre-
 quently as every 6 months if warranted by changing conditions.
    In response to the Exchange's proposals, the Commission recon-
vened its commission rate hearings from July 20 through August 7,
 1970, to receive testimony and other relevant data concerning such
proposals," After reviewing these materials, the Commission an-
nounced on October 22, 1970, that it would not object if the pro-
posed schedules were adopted, with certain modifications, upon the
understanding that the Exchange would take specified steps to pro-
vide a better basis for the determination of future commission rates.
The Commission concluded (i) that the proposed increases in rates
 for round-lot orders of 100 through 400 shares were unreasonable and
 (ii) that the proposed rate schedule was unreasonable to the extent
that it fixed charges for that portion of an order in excess of
$100,000. Modification of the proposed rate schedule would, there-
fore, be required in these areas. The Commission's action was also
conditioned on the understanding that no member firm which tradi-
tionally has accepted small customer accounts will impose or con-
tinue any limitation on the size of such customer's order or account
and that in connection with such business the firm will not charge
fees in excess of the proposed rates.
    The Commission has requested the Exchange to present on or be-
fore June 30, 1971, a new rate structure based on a percentage scale
of the money involved in an order, a proposed revision of the intra-
member charges for floor brokerage and clearance, and flo proposal
for reasonable nonmember access. The Exchange was also requested

to develop a uniform system of accounts and uniform methods of
cost allocation by May 31, 1971.4
  2. Interim Surcharge
   On March 19, 1970, the New York Stock Exchange reported to the
Commission that many of its member organizations which do a pub-
lic business had sustained substantial losses in 1969 and that the sit-
uation had further deteriorated in the first quarter of 1970. In an
attempt to provide interim financial relief to its members prior to
any final action by the Commission regarding a permanent r.aite
structure, the Exchange proposed a rule which would require mem-
ber organizations to impose a surcharge in the form of a service fee
of $15 or fifty percent of the applicable minimum commission,
whichever is less, on orders of one thousand shares or less.
   After an analysis of data submitted by the Exchange and addi-
tional data obtained by the staff, the Commission allowed the in-
terim surcharge to take effect on a temporary basis (90 days). The
Commission's action was taken on the condition that full brokerage
services (some of which had recently been denied the small investor)
would be restored and that investors would not be charged more
than the minimum commission plus the surcharge. It was expected
that the additional revenues would be employed by member organi-
zations to improve their operations and financial position. The Com-
mission made it clear that any continuance of the surcharge beyond
the 90-day period would require a review of the economic conditions,
including transaction volume levels, existing at that time," On June
29, 1970, the Exchange submitted to the Commission a request for an
extension of the surcharge.
   On July 2, 1970, the Commission announced that the commission
rate hearings would be reconvened on July 13, 1970, to receive evi-
dence pertinent to the question of whether the interim service charge
should be continued. The Commission further indicated that it
would not take action to prevent the temporary continuation of the
surcharge pending consideration of the evidence to be developed."
The hearings were conducted from July 13 through July 17, 1970.
Upon the basis of its review of monitoring program data and other
relevant information developed in the commission rate hearings, the
Commission on August 31, 1970, announced that conditions did not
warrant termination of the service charge at that time and the sur-
charge would, therefore, be permitted to continue until such time as

circumstances warrant its termination." With the exception of the
90-day limitation, the conditions imposed by the Commission when
the surcharge originally became effective were maintained upon con-
tinuance of the surcharge.
Institutional Investor Study
   The Institutional Investor Study, which resulted from the Con-
 gressional directive to the Commission to study the impact on the
 nation's economy of all types of institutional investors, has contin-
 ued throughout the year," Both the language and the legislative
 background of Public Law 90--438authorizing the Study make clear
that the Congress expects a comprehensive economic study, whose
first task will be to remedy sizable gaps in information about the ac-
tivities of institutional investors and their impacts on both the securi-
ties markets and corporate issuers.
   From the beginning, the Study has been envisioned as a massive
 fact-finding effort whose talents, energies and resources would be
concentrated on the collection and analysis of information about in-
stitutional investors that has not been available before. The pri-
mary vehicles used for this purpose have been detailed question-
naires, supplemented by interviews, on the organization and operation
of institutional investors and securities firms and on their holdings
and transactions in portfolio securities.
   The Study has developed, distributed, collected, corrected and an-
alyzed data from 55 separate questionnaires, each of which covers as
many as 14 separate types of respondent institutions, some of which
include as many as 1,000 responding firms. Each of these question-
naires was developed in consultation with ad hoc technical commit-
tees voluntarily formed by the industries studied. The first of these
questionnaires was mailed to respondents during September 1969,
and the final questionnaire was mailed in April 1970.
   The second stage of the major data collection effort by the Study
has involved the collection, editing, correction and preparation for
machine processing of questionnaire returns. The extent of industry
cooperation with the Commission is demonstrated by the willingness
of the great majority of respondents to return the data in machine-
readable forms. More than 700,000punched-card responses have been
returned by private persons or firms. In addition, other agencies of
the government have made important contributions to this effort.
Analyses are being conducted on large, high-speed computers pro-

Annual Report, pp, ~12.

 vided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Fed-
 eral Reserve Board.
   A primary interest of the Study has been the extent to which the
 performance phenomenon has spread to different sectors of the
 money management industry, and what its implications have been
 for the structure of our securities markets, brokerage firms, corpo-
 rate issuers and individual investors. Much of the data collected and
 analyzed by the Study bear directly on this important phenomenon.
   The Congress, by Joint Resolution, recently extended the report-
 ing date of the Institutional Investor Study to December 31, 1970.o
Implementation of the Recommendations of the Disclosure Policy Study
    During the fiscal year the Commission published for public com-
 ment proposals to implement a number of the recommendations made
 in the Report of the Disclosure Policy Study." There were 349 let-
 ters of comment, covering 1,165 pages, in response to these propos-
 als, all of which were considered by the staff and the Commission.
 As described below, the Commission has recently made certain deter-
 minations on a number of the proposals.
    The Commission decided not to adopt the proposed 160 series of
 rules relating to underwriters, nonpublic offerings, and brokers'
transactions and, as an alternative, has proposed to adopt Rule 144.11
 The proposed rule would provide that any affiliate of a company
 (i.e., any person in a control relationship with the company) who
offers or sells securities of such company in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the rule is presumed not to be an under-
writer of the securities within the meaning of Section 2 (11) of the
Securities Act of 1933 and is further presumed not to be an "issuer"
within the meaning of the last sentence of that section, which would
make his selling broker an underwriter. There would also be a pre-
sumption that any other person who, in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the rule, offers or sells securities which he acquired
from the issuer or from an affiliate of such issuer in a nonpublic trans-
action is not an underwriter of the securities within the meaning of
Section 2 (11) .
   Under the proposed rule, the person making the offering must
have owned the securities at least 18 months; however, the estate of
a deceased owner of securities, if not affiliated with the issuer, need
not conform to any holding period.

10                SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

   The proposed rule also provides that there must be publicly avail-
able current financial and other information concerning the issuer.
There is a presumption under the proposed rule that the required in-
formation is available with respect to an issuer which is required to
and does file reports pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securi-
ties Exchange Act of 1934. With respect to other issuers, the seller
of the securities and the brokers involved in the transaction would
have the obligation to determine whether adequate current informa-
tion is publicly available. Factors that would have to be considered
in making such determination are whether a reasonably current bal-
ance sheet and a profit and loss statement and current material in-
formation about the issuer's business and management have been
published or furnished to security holders.
   The proposed rule further provides that, after the requisite hold-
ing period, the securities may be sold only in brokers' transactions
and only in limited quantities in any 12-month period. The quantity
limitations are related to the amount of the class of securities out-
standing or, if the security is traded on a securities exchange, to re-
cent trading volume. Sales by members of a person's family and
other associates would be considered sales by that person for pur-
poses of determining the quantity he may sell during the relevant
period.
   Should proposed Rule 144 be adopted, the staff of the Commission
will not thereafter issue "no action" letters with respect to matters
covered by the provisions of the rule. The burden will be on the sell-
ers of securities to ascertain that an exemption is available.
   The Commission also revised certain of the registration and re-
porting forms under the Securities Exchange Act, including Form
10, the general form for the registration of securities of commercial
and industrial companies pursuant to Section 12 of the Act.12 To a
large extent the revision of that form consists of amplification of the
instructions to indicate more precisely the information required to
be given. In addition, a new item has been added to the form calling
for a summary of operations for the past 5 years, similar to the
summary required in registration statements under the Securities
Act of 1933. The item relating to the registrant's business calls for
disclosure of certain information as to backlog of orders, if applica-
ble and material to an understanding of the business, and for the es-
timated dollar amount spent during each of the last 2 fiscal years on
material research activities.
   The disclosure requirements relating to management, remuneration
 and transactions with insiders were revised so as to bring them into

                     THIRTY-SIXTH      ANNUAL REPORT                       11
 accord with the corresponding requirements under the Commission's
  proxy rules. In addition, a statement of source and application of
 funds for each of the 3 fiscal years for which a profit and loss state-
 ment is required must be included with the financial statements. Al-
 though the draft of the proposed form as published for comment
 would have required certain additional information in regard to op-
 erations of companies in extractive industries, the Commission deter-
 mined not to adopt these revisions at this time.
    Form lo-K, the annual report for companies which are required
 to file reports pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities
 Exchange Act, has also been revised." The purpose of the revisions
 is to provide on an annual basis information which, together with that
 contained in the proxy or information statement sent to security
 holders, will provide a reasonably complete and up-to-date statement
 of the business and operations of the registrant.
    Primarily, the revised form provides for more detailed disclosure
 by companies engaged in more than one line of business; 14 requires
 a summary of operations for the past 5 years similar to that re-
 quired under revised Form 10; and calls for a description of the
 properties of the registrant and its subsidiaries. The items relating
to management, remuneration and transactions with insiders con-
tained in Part II of the form have been revised to bring them into
accord with the corresponding requirements of the Commission's
proxy rules. The instructions as to financial statements have been re-
vised to require comparative financial statements, including a source
and application of funds statement, for the last 2 fiscal years.
   A new form for quarterly reports under the Securities Exchange
Act, Form lo-Q, was adopted to replace Form 9-K which has
been rescinded.w Reports on Form lo-Q are to be filed within 45
days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each
fiscal year by issuers which file annual reports on Form 10-K,
12-K or U5S.
   The form calls for summarized financial information which is not
required to be certified. Profit and loss information in more detail
than was required by Form 9-K must also be furnished, including
data on earnings per share. In addition, information is required in
regard to the registrant's capitalization and stockholders' equity. Re-
ports on Form lo-Q are not deemed to be "filed" for the purpose of

  1S Securities Exchange Act Release No. 9000 (October 21, 1970).
  14 A similar requirement had previously been added to Form 10 and certain
registration forms under the Securities Act of 1933. See 35th Annual Report,
pp.22-24-
  15 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 9004 (October 28,1970).
12             SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the liability provisions of Section 18 of the Act but are subject to all
other provisions of the Act.
   The proposed Form 10-Q which was published for comment 16
would have required the reporting on a quarterly basis of certain
specified events similar to those required to be reported on Form
8-K. The form would also have required the prompt reporting of
 any significant acquisitions of assets or businesses along with finan-
cial statements of businesses acquired. After further consideration,
the Commission determined not to rescind Form 8-K at this time
and to adopt as Form 10-Q only that portion of the proposed form
which relates to the quarterly reporting of summarized financial in-
 formation.
   A new Form 7-Q, to replace Form 7-K which has been rescinded,
was adopted for quarterly reports of certain real estate companies
under the Securities Exchange Act.17 It provides for the furnishing
of the same type of financial information as Form 10-Q.
   The Commission also adopted certain amendments to Form S-7
under the Securities Act of 1933.18 This is a short form which may
be used for registration of securities to be offered to the public for
cash by companies having established records of earnings and stabil-
ity of management and business. The amendments are primarily de-
signed to broaden the availability of Form 8-7 by relaxing the
qualifying conditions which have been placed upon its use.
   Heretofore, in order to use the form, a registrant, among other
things, must have been subject to and complied with the requirements
of Sections 13 and 14 of the Securities Exchange Act for a period of
at least 5 fiscal years. This period has been reduced to 3 fiscal years.
Further, the precondition that the registrant must have been en-
gaged in a business of substantially the same character for its last 5
fiscal years has been deleted; additional information must now be
supplied as to material changes, if any, in the general character of
the business during the 5-year period.
   The previous condition that a majority of the existing directors of
the registrant must have been directors during each of the last 3
fiscal years has been amended to require that a majority of the exist-
ing board must have been directors of the registrant or a predecessor
during each of the last 3 fiscal years.
   In another area, it was previously required that the registrant and
its consolidated subsidiaries must have had sales or gross revenues of
at least $50 million for the last fiscal year and net income of at least

$2.5 million for such fiscal year and $1 million for each of the pre-
ceding 4 fiscal years. The revised form deletes the requirement with
respect to sales or gross revenues and provides that the registrant
need only have had a net income after taxes, but before extraordi-
nary items, of at least $500,000 for each of the last 5 fiscal years.
  Finally, the form was amended to require a source and application
of funds statement for each fiscal year or other period for which an
income statement is required.
Legislative Reform of the Investment Company Act
    Efforts to obtain much needed reform of the Investment Company
 Act of 1940 have continued in the Second Session of the 91st Con-
 gress. As described in previous Annual Reports, legislation which
 would have implemented proposals of the Commission was origi-
 nally introduced in May 1967.19 The principal Commission proposals
 involved the reduction of sales loads imposed on the acquisition of
 fund shares, the elimination of the so-called "front-end load," and
 establishment of a means to test the fairness of management fees.
 The proposals also dealt with a number of other areas which in the
 Commission's opinion required legislative action.
   As noted in the Commission's last Annual Report, on June 10,
 1969, Chairman Moss of the Subcommittee on Commerce and Fi-
 nance of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce intro-
duced H.R. 11995 (91st Cong., 1st Sess.), This bill, which is identical
to the bill that had passed the Senate in May 1969, S. 2224 (91st
 Cong., 1st Sess.), embodied many of the Commission's original legis-
lative recommendations. In November and December, 1969, the above
 Subcommittee held hearings on H'R. 11995, as well as on HiR. 14737
introduced by Congressman W. S. Stuckey on November 6, 1969,
and a similar bill, R.R. 12867, previously introduced by Congress-
man Stuckey. On April 29, 1970, Congressman Harley O. Staggers
introduced another bill, H.R. 17333 (91st Cong., 2nd Sess.}, which
was similar to the Stuckey bills, and on that date the Subcommittee
reported that bill, rather than H.R. 11995, to the full Committee on
Interstate and Foreign Commerce. After further consideration, the
full Committee approved several amendments to conform H.R. 17333
more closely to S. 2224 and favorably reported it to the House. On
September 23, 1970, the House passed H.R. 17333 by voice vote with
a minor amendment. The House and Senate then appointed confer-
ees to meet and attempt to agree on a version acceptable to both

and 33rd Annual Report, pp. 1-6.
14                SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Houses. At the writing of this Report in October 1970, the conferees
had not yet met and the legislation was still pending. *
   In proposing mutual fund legislation in 1967, the Commission rec-
ognized that most of the specific abuses aimed at in the Investment
Company Act had been substantially eliminated. However, the dra-
matic growth of the industry and accompanying changes have cre-
ated new situations which were not anticipated in 1940. While the
industry accepted or even welcomed many of the changes proposed
by the Commission, it took exception to the principal recommenda-
tions of the Commission, and as a result these have been modified in
the pending legislation. And, while many of the provisions of H.R.
17333 are the same as those found in S. 2224, there are significant
differences, described below.
  1. Investment    Advisory Fees
   The Commission had recommended that the Act be amended to
provide expressly that compensation received by investment advisers
and other persons affiliated with investment companies shall be "rea-
sonable" and that there be opportunity for judicial enforcement of
this standard. This recommendation reflected the Commission's view
that a requirement that compensation not be unreasonable was inher-
ent in the fiduciary relationship existing between an investment com-
pany and its manager or adviser. The Commission also considered
that the Federal courts would provide an appropriate forum in
which the reasonableness of compensation could be tested.
   S. 3724 (90th Cong., 2nd Sess.), a bill which had passed the Sen-
ate in July 1968, substantially adopted these recommendations, with
certain changes designed to meet some of the industry's objections.
However, the industry, while not objecting to the concept that com-
pensation should be reasonable, continued to oppose the form of the
amendments. Following the April 1969 Senate hearings, the Com-
mission and industry representatives resumed their discussions of
this matter and in May 1969 agreed on and jointly submitted to the
Senate Committee a substitute provision which specified that an in-
vestment adviser has a fiduciary duty with respect to such compen-
sation. This was in accord with the Commission's recommendation
that the presently applicable standards of "waste" and "gross abuse
of trust" as applied to management fees be replaced with a more
meaningful standard. The Senate Committee and the Senate adopted

  • Amended versions of S. 2224 were passed by both the Senate and the House
and then went to a Conference Committee. The Committee's report (H. Rept. No.
91-1631) of November 25,1970 was accepted in both houses and the enrolled bill
was signed by the President on December 14, 1970 90S Public Law 91-547.
                    THIRTY-SIXTH   ANNUAL REPORT                     15
in S. 2224 the management fee proposal in substantially the lan-
guage proposed by the Commission and the industry representatives.
   H.R. 17333, like S. 2224, contains, in Section 20 of the bill, a pro-
vision declaring that the investment adviser of a registered investment
company has a fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of compen-
sation and authorizing the Commission, or a security holder of the
investment company, to bring an action in court for breach of this
fiduciary duty. The provisions in both bills on this subject are much
the same, although H.R. 17333 requires a security holder to be "act-
ing in good faith and with justifiable cause" while S. 2224 contains
no such restriction.
  2. Performance   Fees
   Performance-based fees are a specialized type of advisory compen-
sation which have been used increasingly in recent years. TIns type
of compensation arrangement generally relates the adviser's compen-
sation either to the realized or unrealized appreciation of the client's
portfolio or to the performance of a specified securities index. The
proposed legislation, in addition to subjecting such arrangements to
the fiduciary standards of Section 36(b), includes provisions specifi-
cally directed to performance-based fees. The Commission originally
proposed that the prohibition of performance-based fees now appli-
cable to advisers of private clients be extended to advisers of regis-
tered investment companies. However, after discussion with industry
representatives, a modified provision, permitting a limited type of
performance fee, was incorporated into S. 2224 and H.R. 17333.
Under that provision, contracts which base any part of the adviser's
fee on a specified percentage of the company's capital appreciation
would be prohibited. On the other hand, fees which increase and de-
crease proportionately on the basis of investment performance meas-
ured against an appropriate index of securities prices or other ap-
propriate measure of performance would be permissible, The "base"
or "standard" fee would be permitted only at the point that the
fund's performance equals that of the index.
   However, H.R. 17333 would make this prohibition of performance
fees inapplicable to contracts made by registered investment advisers
with certain types of "off-shore" funds.
  3. The Front-End Load on Contractual Plans
   The Commission had recommended the abolition of the so-called
"front-end load" on periodic payment plan certificates (i.e., certifi-
cates issued in connection with contractual plans for the accumula-
tion of fund shares on an installment basis) under which as much as
50 percent of the payments made by the investor during the first
16            SECURITIES   AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

year may be deducted for sales charges. S. 2224 and H.R. 17333 per-
mit a front-end load under two alternative methods. Under the first
alternative provided in S. 2224, periodic payment plan certificates
could be sold with the presently authorized 50 percent front-end
load, provided that, if the investor elected for any reason to redeem
his certificate for cash during the first 3 years after its issuance, he
would be entitled to receive a refund of the net asset value of his
certificate plus the difference between the total sales charges paid by
him and 15percent of such payments. H.R. 17333,however, would per-
mit a refund only within the first year and then only of the excess sales
charge over 20 percent. Under both bills, the Commission would be
authorized to adopt rules and regulations specifying the form of re-
fund notice and setting forth reserve requirements so that sellers
could meet their obligations.
  The other alternative, provided by both bills, would permit sellers
of periodic payment plan certificates to charge a sales load which
does not exceed 20 percent of any payment nor average more than 16
percent over the first four years.
  4. Levels of Sales Charges
  The Commission had originally proposed that a 5 percent ceiling
be placed on the charge for mutual fund sales subject to authority in
the Commission to approve appropriate higher ceilings. S. 2224 and
H.R. 17333 would give the National Association of Securities Deal-
ers ("NASD") authority to make rules to prevent excessive sales
charges, subject to Commission oversight.
  5. Bank and Savings and Loan Administered Investment Companies
   S. 2224 expressly permits the operation by banks of so-called
"commingled managing agency accounts," functionally identical to
mutual funds. That bill, as well as H.R. 17333,permits the commin-
gled agency account to have a majority of its directors affiliated
with the bank or the savings and loan association. Both bills also
impose specific restrictions on the operation of such acconnts includ-
ing a prohibition on the charging of any sales load. However, H.R.
17333 would not expressly permit the operation of such investment
companies, but would make their operation subject to the provisions
and restrictions of other state and Federal law. Thus, under H.R.
17333 the right of banks and savings and loan associations to oper-
ate registered investment companies would be determined either by
subsequent legislation or by interpretation of existing legislation,
primarily the national banking laws. The question of whether banks
may operate such funds consistent with the national banking laws is
now pending in the United States Supreme Court in Investment
Oompany Institute v, Oamp (No. 61, October Term 1970).

  6. Oil and Gas Drilling Funds
    S. 2224 would amend Section 3 (c) (11) of the Act to terminate the
 exclusion from the Act of those oil and gas funds which issue re-
 deemable securities or sell their securities on the installment plan.
 Oil and gas funds in which investors make only a single payment
 and do not receive a redeemable security would still be excluded
 from the definition of investment company.
    The new provision would not become effective until 18 months
 after passage. The discussion on the floor of the Senate regarding S.
 2224 makes it clear that it is intended that the Commission and oil
 and gas industry representatives confer during that interval to work
out an equitable arrangement for regulation which would protect
 investors and not impose an unreasonable burden on the industry.
    Subsequent to the passage of S. 2224, the Commission staff con-
 ferred with representatives of the oil and gas industry. During hear-
 ings before the House Subcommittee in December 1969, the Commis-
 sion confirmed its original view that there is a need for regulation to
 some degree of the type provided in the Investment Company Act
 for this industry but that such regulation would appear to present
 certain real problems for the industry, primarily because of the dif-
ficulty of accommodating the industry structure contemplated by the
 Investment Company Act with the structure in fact adopted by this
 industry in order to provide favorable treatment for its investors
 under the Internal Revenue Code.
   Therefore, the Commission stated to the House Subcommittee that
if the Committee wished to delete the oil and gas amendment from
the bill, the Commission would not object. The Commission stated
that it made this suggestion on the assumption that representatives
of the oil and gas industry would cooperate with the Commission in
drafting a reasonable regulatory statute consistent with the protec-
tion of investors for submission to Congress within 18 months after
passage of the mutual fund legislation. Subsequently, in reporting
H.R. 17333 to the House of Representatives, the Committee on In-
terstate and Foreign Commerce deleted the amendment, explaining
that it had done so because of the assurance of the Commission and
industry representatives that they will work diligently and expedi-
tiously toward the goal of recommending an effective scheme for
providing investor protection in this area and that those recommen-
dations will be available to the Congress before 18 months after the
enactment of mutual fund legislation. In the event this goal is not
achieved, the Commission will submit appropriate legislation in the
next Congress to provide necessary investor protection in this area.

    7. Fund Holding Companies
    The Commission originally recommended and has always adhered
 to the view that fund holding companies should be prohibited."
 Nevertheless, S. 2224 and H.ll. 17333 permit the operation of fund
 holding companies subject to specified restrictions, of which the most
 significant are the requirement that not more than 3 percent of any
 stock of any individual investment company may be owned by such
 a holding company and that only one percent of the securities of
 any portfolio fund may be redeemed in any period of less than 30
 days. S. 2224 provides that the sales load of the holding company
 cannot exceed 1% percent, but H.ll. 17333 diverges from this re-
 quirement by permitting any sales load which, when added to the
 sales load for acquisition of stock in any portfolio fund, is not exces-
 sive under Section 22(b) of the Act and applicable NASD or Com-
 mission rules.
   8. The Front-End Load on Face-Amount Certificates
    On August 27, 1969, the Commission submitted to the Senate
 Committee on Banking and Currency a "Report on Face-Amount
 Certificate Companies," the result of an in-depth study conducted at
 the request of the Committee." In this Report, the Commission reas-
 serted the position taken in its 1966 report that the imposition of the
 front-end load on installment face-amount certificates (i.e., certifi-
 cates which have a fixed ultimate value and a reduced rate of return
if redeemed prior to maturity) is contrary to the public interest and
the interest of investors. It recommended that such practice, as well
 as the practice of imposing equivalent surrender charges, be discon-
tinued. A bill, H.ll. 13754,which would implement the Commission's
recommendation, was introduced in the House of Representatives on
September 11, 1969.
   While H.ll. 13754 was not reported to the House of Representa-
tives by the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, H.R.
17333 would provide for a type of spread load for sales charges on
face-amount certificates. It would require that the front-end load be
spread over the first 5 years of the plan so that, in effect, a 20 per-
cent load would be taken in each of the first 3 years, a 10 percent
load in the fourth year, a 7 percent load in the fifth year, and no
more than a 4 percent load in all subsequent years. This change, for

 the most part, reflects existing industry practice. Over 95 percent of
 face-amount certificate sales are now being made within this pro-
 posed limitation.
 Other Pending Legislation
   I. Increase in Exemption for Small Issues of Securities
    S. 336, which would amend Section 3 (b) of the Securities Act of
  1933 to increase from $300,000 to $500,000 the maximum aggregate
  amount of securities which may be exempted from registration
  under the Act pursuant to rules and regulations of the Commission
  (the most widely used of which is Regulation A), was introduced in
 the Senate on January 16, 1969.
    When the Act was passed in 1933, the limitation under Section
 3 (b) was set at $100,000.A 1945 amendment increased the amount to
 $300,000. Costs have risen throughout the economy since the last
 amendment with the result that the $300,000 of 1945 has substan-
tially less purchasing power today. In many cases it is an inadequate
 amount to finance properly either a small established business seek-
 ing to modernize or expand, or a newly organized venture requiring
a substantial amount of seed capital. Since the original purpose of
 Section 3 (b) was to aid small businesses in raising capital, the Com-
mission believes that a further increase in the exemption is appro-
priate at this time and it has accordingly supported the bill.
    S. 336 was passed by the Senate on August 13, 1970, and was
transmitted to the House where it is pending before the Committee
on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. Hearings on the bill were held
before the House Committee on October 12, 1970.*
  2. Amendment to Take-Over Bid Law
   The take-over bid law (commonly referred to as the Williams
 Bill), which was enacted on July 29, 1968, was designed to provide
 for appropriate disclosure in connection with the solicitation of
tender offers for securities and other large securities acquisitions and
to give the Commission additional powers to prevent improper prac-
tices in those contexts. The experience gained in administering this
law has demonstrated certain areas in which the Commission be-
lieves its effectiveness could be improved. At the request of the Se-
curities Subcommittee of the Senate Banking and Currency Com-
mittee, the Commission prepared a draft bill covering these areas,
and Senator Harrison A. Williams, Jr., the Chairman of that Sub-

   *8. 336 was passed by the House on December 7, 1970. The enrolled bill was
signed by the President on December 19,1970 and is now Public Law 91-565.
20               SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

 committee and the sponsor of the original law, introduced this draft
bill as S. 3431 on February 10, 1970.
   S. 3431 would revise the take-over law in five respects. The most
important of these would be to decrease from 10 percent to 5 percent
the amount of stock ownership which would bring the law's provi-
sions into play. The principal reason for this proposed revision is
that there is evidence that disclosure has frequently been avoided by
limiting acquisitions of a company's securities to around nine per-
cent. The other revisions would extend the coverage of the law to in-
surance companies; would require disclosure where the take-over is
effected by means of an exchange of securities and not only, as
under present law, where it is effected by cash purchase of shares;
and would generally broaden the Commission's rule-making power
in the take-over area.
   S. 3431 was passed by the Senate on August 18, 1970, and was
transmitted to the House of Representatives where hearings were
held on October 12, 1970, before the House Committee on Interstate
and Foreign Commerce. Chairman Budge testified in support of the
bill on the Senate side on March 25, 1970, and on the House side on
October 12, 1970.*
   3. Transfer of Public Utility Holding Company Act Functions to Federal
      Power Commission
   On December 2, 1969, the Commission transmitted to the Congress
a draft bill which would transfer to the Federal Power Commission
most of the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission
under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. Under this
bill the SEC would retain only the types of responsibilities with re-
spect to such holding companies which it now exercises as to pub-
licly owned corporations generally, such as those relating to proxy
solicitations, periodic reports, and insider trading. Jurisdiction over
such companies would also be retained under the Securities Act of
1933and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.
   Congressman Staggers introduced the bill in the House of Repre-
sentatives on January 22, 1970, as H.R. 15516, and it was referred to
the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce where it is still
pending. The Commission favors the bill on the ground that the
principal mission entrusted to it of eliminating or reorganizing the

   *S. 3431, with added amendments, was passed by the House on December 7,
1!)70.The final version of the bill was passed by the Senate and the House, respee-
ttvely, on December 9 and 10, 1970. The enrolled bill was signed by tbe President
on December 22,1970 and is now Public Law 91-567.

complex, unwieldy, and unsound holding company strnctures has
largely been accomplished and the present problems of the industry
relate primarily to technological developments as to which the Fed-
eral Power Commission has more familiarity.*

   *As this report goes to press, H.R. 15516 is still in Committee on the House
side and no corresponding bill has ever been introduced in the Senate.
                               PART II
     FULL DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION                  ABOUT THE
                ISSUERS OF SECURITIES
    One basic purpose of the Federal securities laws administered by
the Commission, in particular the Securities Act of 1933 and the Se-
curities Exchange Act of 1934, is to provide disclosure of financial
 and other information about publicly held companies and those com-
 panies seeking to raise capital through the public offering of their
securities, so as to enable public investors to evaluate the securities
 of these companies on an informed and realistic basis. To this end,
the Securities Act, generally speaking, requires a company propos-
ing to offer its securities to the public to file a registration statement
with the Commission disclosing prescribed categories of financial
and other information and further requires that in connection with
the sale of the securities investors be furnished a prospectus contain-
ing the most significant information set forth in the registration
statement. The Securities Exchange Act, which deals in large part
with securities already outstanding, requires the registration of secu-
rities listed on a national securities exchange as well as of over-the-
counter securities in which there is a substantial public interest. It
also requires the issuers of such securities to file annual and other
periodic reports which are designed to keep the information in the
Exchange Act registration statement current. That Act also requires
disclosure of material information to holders of registered securities
in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the election of
directors or the approval of corporate action at a stockholders' meet-
ing, and in connection with attempts to acquire control of a com-
pany through a tender offer or other planned stock acquisition, and
it requires "insiders" of companies whose equity securities are regis-
tered to report their holdings of and transactions in all equity secu-
rities of the company with which they are affiliated.
     A. DISCLOSURE IN CONNECTION WITH PUBUC OFFERINGS
  In order to provide disclosure with respect to securities to be of-
fered for public sale, either by an issuing company or a person in a
control relationship to such company, the Securities Act requires
that, unless an exemption is available for the securities or the partie-
                    THIRTY-SIXTH     ANNUAL REPORT                     23
 ular offering, (1) a registration statement containing certain re-
quired financial and other information be filed with the Commission,
and (2) a prospectus which is a part of the registration statement
 and contains the more significant data set forth in that statement be
furnished to investors so as to enable them to evaluate the securities
 and make an informed investment decision.
   The registration statement is available for public inspection as
soon as it is filed. Although the securities may be offered for sale
upon filing of the statement under prescribed limitations, actual
sales may not be made until the statement has become effective. The
Commission has no authority to pass on the merits of the securities
to be offered or the fairness of the terms of distribution. In fact, the
Act makes it unlawful to represent to investors that the Commission
has approved or otherwise passed on the merits of registered securi-
ties.
Type of Information Included in Registration Statement
    Generally speaking, a registration statement relating to securities
 issued by a corporation or other private issuer must contain the in-
 formation specified in Schedule A of the Act, while a statement re-
 lating to securities issued by a foreign government must include the
 information specified in Schedule B. The Act empowers the Com-
 mission to classify issues, issuers and prospectuses, to prescribe ap-
 propriate forms, and to increase, or in certain instances vary or di-
minish, the particular items of information required to be disclosed
as the Commission deems appropriate in the public interest or for
the protection of investors. To facilitate the registration of securities
 by different types of issuing companies, the Commission has pre-
pared special registration forms which vary in their disclosure re-
quirements so as to provide maximum disclosure of the essential
facts pertinent in a given type of offering while at the same time
minimizing the burden and expense of compliance with the law.
   In general, the registration statement of an issuer other than a
foreign government must disclose such matters as the names of per-
sons who participate in the management or control of the issuer's
business; the security holdings and remuneration of such persons;
the general character of the business, its capital structure, past his-
tory and earnings; underwriters' commissions; payments to promot-
ers made within 2 years or intended to be made; the interest of
directors, officers and principal stockholders in material transactions
with the issuer; pending legal proceedings; and the purposes to
which the proceeds of the offering are to be applied, and must in-
clude financial statements certified by an independent accountnnt.
24              SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The registration statement of a foreign government must contain in-
formation concerning the purposes for which the proceeds of the of-
fering are to be used, the natural and industrial resources of the is-
suer, its revenues, obligations and expenses, the underwriting and
distribution of the securities being registered, and other material
matters, but need not contain certified financial statements.
Guides for Preparation and Filing of Registration Statements
   During the fiscal year, the Commission continued its publication
of guides for the preparation and filing of registration statements
under the Securities Act. These guides represent policies and prac-
tices followed by the Commission's Division of Corporation Finance
in the administration of the registration requirements of the Act.
They do not, however, purport to furnish complete criteria for the
preparation of registration statements.
   One guide adopted during the year, relating to the misleading
character of certain registrants' names, was discussed in the 35th
Annual Report.' In January 1970, a guide concerning the prepara-
tion of prospectuses relating to interests in oil and gas programs
was published." The guide indicated the general content of disclosures
to be made in such prospectuses, and the sequence in which they
should appear. It is designed to obtain, to the extent feasible, uni-
formity in both the sequence and general content of disclosure, and
should sene to assist issuers in the preparation of registration state-
ments on Form S-l as well as offering circulars under Regulation
A involving oil and gas drilling programs and to facilitate the un-
derstanding and analysis of such programs by investors.
   In March 1970, a proposed guide relating to the interests of coun-
sel and experts in the registrant was published." The release stated
that it had come to the attention of the Division that persons who
are named in the prospectus as counsel for the issuer or underwriter
with respect to a registration statement, as well as counsel who pass
upon the legality of the securities being registered, are in some cases

or rights to subscribe thereto, or are associated with owners of such
securities or rights. The proposed guide would point out that in such
cases the interest of these persons and their associates in the regis-
trant and the offering should be disclosed. It would also draw atten-

tion to the fact that counsel's interest in the issuer or participation
in its affairs may constitute him a promoter, finder, or executive of-
ficer, in which case specific disclosures with respect to such relation-
ship are required by the registration forms. The guide would also
point out that similar considerations may apply to persons named as
experts in the prospectus.
Amendment of Rules Relating to Industrial Revenue Bonds
   Rule 131 under the Securities Act and Rule 3b-5 under the Se-
curities Exchange Act of 1934 relating to "industrial revenue bonds"
were amended during the fiscal year.' These rules are designed to de-
fine the circumstances under which bonds issued by a municipality
or other governmental unit are deemed to involve the issuance of a
separate security by an industrial or commercial enterprise under a
lease, sale or loan arrangement. The purpose of the amendment was
to clarify exclusionary paragraphs describing certain situations
where no such separate security is deemed to be involved.
   Questions had been raised whether such a security was involved
where bonds were issued by municipal and other governmental units
to finance airport improvements for leasing to airlines serving their
areas. In view of the concern expressed that the exclusionary para-
graphs in their original form might be construed as being applicable
only if a particular airport facility, such as a hangar, were to be op-
erated and controlled by or on behalf of a governmental unit, the
Commission amended these paragraphs to make it clear that it is not
their purpose to require that each separate facility constituting part
of a public project be operated and controlled by a governmental
unit if the project as a whole is owned by and under the general
control of a governmental unit or instrumentality thereof.
   The amendment also made it explicit that the rules do not apply
to any obligation which is payable not only out of the payments
from the lease or other arrangements with an industrial or commer-
cial enterprise but also from other substantial sources of revenue of
the governmental unit.
Amendments of Rules Relating to Mechanics of Filing
  The Commission adopted certain amendments to Rules 402, 424,
470 and 472 under the Securities Act, which relate to the mechanics

rules as originally adopted, see 34th Annual Report, pp. 21-22. Under Public Law
91-567 (December 22, 1970), certain industrial development bonds are exempt
from the registration provisions of 'the Securities Act and Securitles Exchange
Act and the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.
26             SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

of filing registration statements and amendments to such statements,
so as to facilitate compliance with the rules and expedite the filing
and examination of such documents." The amendments related prin-
cipally to the number of copies which must be filed.
Amendment of Form 8-7
   Section 10(b) of the Securities Act authorizes the Commission to
provide for the use of a summary prospectus which may be readily
transmitted through the mail or published in certain periodicals. It
is intended to enable an issuer or underwriter to secure indications
of interest prior to furnishing the complete prospectus. However, a
copy of the complete prospectus must be furnished upon consumma-
tion of any sale of the securities. Rule 434A under the Act permits
the use of summary prospectuses if the form used for registration of
the securities to be offered provides for the use of such a prospectus
and if the registrant files reports with the Commission pursuant to
Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or meets
certain other conditions specified in the rule. Form S-7, which had
not previously contained instructions permitting the use of summary
prospectuses, was amended to add such instructions. 6
Whisky Warehouse Receipts as Securities
   Faced with an increase in the public promotion and distribution
of whisky warehouse receipts, the Commission during the year called
attention to the fact that the promotion and sale of such receipts
may involve an offering of a security in the form of an investment
contract within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities
Exchange Act and that any public offering of such securities must
comply with the disclosure and antifraud provisions of those acts,"
   In most cases, the whisky warehouse receipts have been sold in
order to finance risks involved in the final production of a blended
whisky. A receipt ordinarily covers casks of unblended whisky being
aged in warehouses, and the sales arrangement generally contem-
plates that the whisky will continue to be stored until it is aged and
will eventually be sold for the purchaser to blenders. The Commis-
sion pointed out that a purchaser was not being offered or sold such
receipts with a view to acquiring and taking possession of the
whisky, but was making an investment under an arrangement which

                    THIRTY-SIXTH      ANNUAL REPORT                       27
contemplates that others will perform services to increase the value
of the whisky and eventually sell the whisky under circumstances
expected to result in a profit to him. In this connection, it referred
to the Supreme Court's decision in S.E.O. v, lV. J. Howey 00., 328
U.S. 293, 301 (1946) that the test of whether or not a "security" is
being offered "is whether the scheme involves an investment of
money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely from the
efforts of others. If that test be satisfied, it is immaterial whether
the enterprise is speculative or non-speculative, or whether there is a
sale of property with or without intrinsic value. The statutory policy
of affording broad protection to investors is not to be thwarted by
unrealistic and irrelevant formulae."
Requirement of Deposit on Purchase Price of Stock Prior to Effective Date of
  Registration
   During the fiscal year the Commission issued a release expressing
its concern that Section 5 (a) of the Securities Act was being vio-
lated in connection with some public offerings in which portions of
the issue were reserved for employees or other designees of the regis-
trant and deposits were solicited from them in advance of the effec-
tive date of the registration statement,"
   The Commission reiterated that the time between the filing of a
registration statement and its effective date is a waiting period de-
signed to enable dealers and investors to become familiar with the
securities issue and arrive at "an unhurried decision" as to its mer-
its. The purchase price may not be paid or received during that pe-
riod and no contracts of sale can be made. These requirements, the
Commission pointed out, apply to the offer and sale of securities re-
served for employees and other designees of management as well as
to the balance of the registered offering.
Staff Examination of Registration Statements
   Registration statements filed with the Commission are examined
by its staff for compliance with the standards of adequate and ac-
curate disclosure. This examination is primarily the responsibility of
the Division of Corporation F'inance," Expedited review procedures
adopted in November 1968 to cope with the tremendous volume of
registration statements filed were described on pages 11-12 of the

  S Securities Act Release No. 5071 (June 29,1970).
  9 Statements filed by investment companies registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 are examined by the Division of Corporate Regulation.
See Part V for further discussion of the processing of investment company
registration statements.

 34th .Annual Report. Generally speaking, if it appears that a state-
ment fails to conform, in material respects, with the applicable re-
quirements, the issuing company is notified by a letter of comment
and is afforded an opportunity to file correcting or clarifying
amendments. The Commission also has the power, after notice and
opportunity for hearing, to issue a "stop-order" suspending the
effectiveness of a registration statement if it finds that material rep-
resentations are misleading, inaccurate or incomplete. In certain in-
stances, such as where the deficiencies in a registration statement ap-
pear to stem from careless disregard of applicable requirements or
from a deliberate attempt to conceal or mislead, a letter of comment
is not sent and the Commission either conducts an investigation to
determine whether "stop-order" proceedings should be instituted or
immediately institutes such proceedings. The exercise of the "stop-
order" power during fiscal year 1970is discussed on pages 34-36.
Time Required To Complete Registration
    The Commission's staff endeavors to complete its examination of
 registration statements in as short a time as possible. The Act pro-
 vides that a registration statement shall become effective on the 20th
 day after it is filed (or on the 20th day after the filing of any
 amendment thereto). Since most registration statements require one
 or more amendments, they usually do not become effective until some
 time after the original 20-day period. The period between filing and
effective date is intended to afford investors an opportunity to be-
come familiar with the proposed offering through the dissemination
of the preliminary form of prospectus. The Commission can acceler-
ate the effective date so as to shorten the 20-day waiting period, tak-
ing into account, among other things, the adequacy of the informa-
tion respecting the issuer theretofore available to the public and the
facility with which the facts about the offering can be understood.
   During the fiscal year, 3,393 registration statements became effec-
tive. Of these, 272 were amendments filed by investment companies
pursuant to Section 24(e) of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
which provides for the registration of additional securities through
amendment to an effective registration statement rather than the
filing of a new registration statement. With respect to the remaining
3,121 statements, as a result of the continuing high number of filings
and the resulting backlog the median time from the date of original

filing to effective date rose to 70 calendar days, from 65 days for

Statistics Regarding Registration Statements Filed
   During the 1970 fiscal year, 4,314 registration statements were
filed for offerings of securities aggregating $66.9 billion, as com-
pared with 4,706 registration statements filed during the 1969 fiscal
year for offerings amounting to $86.8 billion. This represents a de-
crease of 8.3 percent in the number of statements filed and 23.0 per-
cent in the dollar amount involved.
   Of the 4,314 registration statements filed in the 1970 fiscal year,
2,071, or 48 percent, were filed by companies that had not previously
filed registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933. Com-
parable figures for the 1969 and 1968 fiscal years were 2,350, or 50
percent, and 893, or 34 percent, respectively.
   A cumulative total of 40,881 registration statements has been filed
under the Act by 17,819 different issuers covering proposed offerings
of securities aggregating over $552.8 billion from the effective date
of the Securities Act of 1933 to Jnne 30, 1970.

Statistics Regarding Securities Registered
   During the fiscal year 1970, a total of 3,389 registrations of securi-
ties in the amount of $59.1 billion became effective under the Securi-
ties Act.10 'Vhile the number of statements showed a moderate de-
cline from the previous year, the dollar amount of registrations was
down 32 percent from the record 1969 fiscal year. The chart on page
32 shows the number and dollar amounts of fully effective registra-
tions from 1935to 1970.
   The above figures cover all effective registrations including sec-
ondary distributions, securities registered for other than cash sale,
and issues reserved for conversion or for options. Of the dollar
amount of securities registered in 1970, 82 percent was for the ac-
count of the issuer for cash sale, 12 percent for the account of the is-
suer for other than cash sale, and 6 percent for the amount of
others.
   The following table compares the volume of securities registered
for the account of the issuer and for the account of others for the
past three fiscal years.

   As the above table shows, the amount of securities offered for cash
sale for the account of the issuer was $3.8 billion less than in the
preceding fiscal year. Registration of securities for the account of
the issuer for other than cash sale was sharply lower than the record
amount of $29.6 billion for this category set in the previous h a 1
year. This decrease primarily reflects the substantial decline in the
volume of swurities registered for purposes of exchange; only $2.0
billion of securities were registered during fiscal year 1970 for ex-
change purposes, as compared to $17.8 billion during the prior year.
Fkgistrations of secondary offerings totaled $3.6 billion, $1.2 billion
less than in the preceding fiscal year. Appendix Table 1 shows the
number of statements which became effective and total dollar
amounts registered for each of the fiscal years 1935-1970, and con-
tains a classification by type of security of issues to be offered for
cilsh sale for account of issuers during those years. More detailed in-
formation for 1970 may be found in Table 2.
   Corporate issues intended for immediate cash sale totaled $26.0
billion, an increase of $8.7 billion over the preceding year. New cor-
porate debt aggregated a record $17.8 billion, as compared to $10.8
billion registered in fiscal year 1969, and was $5.2 billion more t h m
in 1968, the previous record. Common stock accounted for $7.4 bil-
lion of the 1970 volume while preferred stock totaled $768 million.
Most of the issues offered over an extended period were common
stocb. These included investment company issues, stock to be issued
under employee purchase plans and stock called for by warrants and
options.     ,

Examinations and Investigations
   The Commission is authorized by Section 8(e) of the Securities
Act to make an examination in order to determine whether a stop
order proceeding should be instituted under Section 8(d) and in
connection therewith is empowered to examine witnesses and require
the production of pertinent documents. In addition, investigations
into the adequacy and accuracy of registration statements may be
conducted pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Act which authorizes the
Commission to conduct an investigation to determine whether any
provision of the Act or any rule or regulation prescribed thereunder
has been or is about to be violated. The following tabulation shows

tion statements which were in progress during thc ycar :

Stop Order Promedings
  Section 8 ( d ) of the Securities Act givw the Commission the
power, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to issue a stop
order "suspending" the effectiveness of a registration statement
which includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or tlecessary to
make the statements therein not misleading. The effect of a stop
order, which may be issued even after the sale of securities has
begun, is to bar distribution of the securities so long as the order re-
mains in effect. Although losses which may have been suffered by
                          THIRTY-SIXTH          ANNUAL REPORT                         35
investors before issuance of the order are not restored to them by a
stop order, the Commission's decision and the evidence on which it is
based may serve to put them on notice of their rights and aid in
their own recovery suits. As provided by the Act, a stop order is
lifted when the registration statement has been amended to correct
the deficiencies.
   At the beginning of the fiscal year, three stop order proceedings
were pending and during the year six additional proceedings were
instituted. Six of the proceedings were terminated through the issu-
ance of stop orders, in each instance pursuant to an offer of settle-
ment by the registrant consenting to entry of a stop order and,
solely for purposes of the stop order proceeding, to findings of cer-
tain deficiencies in its registration statement. One proceeding was
discontinued subject to certain conditions, and two proceedings re-
mained pending as of the end of the year.
   In the cases where stop orders were issued, the deficiencies in-
volved
        -failure to disclose that the issuer was surety on a personal
     promissory note of its president."
        -failure to disclose that the issuer had sold unregistered
     promissory notes and that such sales, which were in violation of
     Section 5 of the Securities Act, gave rise to a contingent liabil-
     ity to the purchasers of the notes (an additional ground for issu-
     ance of the stop order here was the issuer's failure to cooperate
     in the examination pursuant to Section 8(e) preceding institu-
     tion of the stop order proceedings) .12
        -failure to disclose accurately the principal products which
     the issuer intended to develop and produce, the planned use of
     the proceeds of the proposed stock offering and the cost to its
     president of assets he transferred to the issuer in exchange for
     stock,"
        -failure adequately and accurately to disclose the educational
     and business background of the issuer's president, the fact that
     a similar company while operated by him sustained extensive
     losses and had been subject to a suspension ordered by the Com-

  12   Smentijic   Research Development       00., Securities Act Release No. 5040 (Jan-
uary 26, 1970).
   18 International Patents and Development Oorp., Securities Act Release No.
5006 (September 22, 1969). Pursuant to its settlement, the issuer filed an
amendment correcting the deficiencies in the registration statement, which had
not become effective, and the statement as amended became effective five days
after entry of the stop order.

       mission pursuant to Regulation A of the Securities Act, and the
       fact that the issuer had no patent, prototype or production
       equipment for a device for which a major portion of the pro-
       ceeds was designated."
          -failure to disclose, in a registration statement covering lim-
       ited partnership interests, material facts regarding the history,
       business and control of the parent company of the general part-
       ner for whose stock the limited partnership interests were to be
       exchangeable in the future."
         -failure to disclose adequately and accurately the executive
       functions of a person not named as an officer, the interests of
       management in certain loans made by the issuer and circum-
       stances surrounding the sale of unregistered securities."
   In Doctor Dolittle Animal Fairs, Inc.,17 the Commission found
that the registration statement filed by the issuer, a newly organized
franchise corporation, was materially deficient in describing the expe-
rience and background of its president who was the only full-time
executive employee and the only officer represented to have any
franchise experience. However, during the pendency of the proceed-
ing the issuer filed an amendment which described the institution of
the proceeding, cured the deficiencies and reported that the president
was no longer associated with the company. Under all the circum-
stances, including the facts that none of the securities had been sold
to the public and that there appeared to be no fraudulent intent by
the issuer's management, the Commission found it appropriate to
discontinue the proceeding on the condition that a final corrected
prospectus describing the proceeding and its disposition and a copy
of the Commission's findings and opinion be furnished to all persons
who had received copies of the deficient preliminary prospectus.
         EXEMPTION      FROM REGISTRATION         OF SMAIL ISSUES
   The Commission is authorized under Section 3 (b) of the Securi-
ties Act to exempt, by its rules and regulations and subject to such
terms and conditions as it may prescribe therein, any class of securi-
ties from registration under the Act, if it finds that the enforcement
of the registration provisions of the Act with respect to such securi-
ties is not necessary in the public interest and for the protection of

 investors by reason of the small amount involved or the limited
 character of the public offering. The statute imposes a maximum
 limitation of $300,000 upon the size of the issues which may be ex-
 empted by the Commission in the exercise of this power."
    Acting under this authority, the Commission has adopted the fol-
 lowing exemptive rules and regulations:
     Rule 234: Exemption of first lien notes.
     Rule 235: Exemption of securities of cooperative housing corporations.
     Rule 236: Exemption of shares offered in connection with certain trans-
                  actions.
     Regulation A: General exemption for U.S. and Canadian issues up to
                      $300,000.
     Regulation B: Exemption for fractional undivided interests in oil or gas
                      rights up to $100,000.
     Regulation F: Exemption for assessments on assessable stock and for as-
                      sessable stock offered or sold to realize the amount of as-
                      sessment thereon.
    Under Section 3 (c) of the Securities Act, which was added by
  Section 307(a) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, the
 Commission is authorized to adopt rules and regulations exempting
 securities issued by a small business investment company under the
 Small Business Investment Act. Acting pursuant to this authority
 the Commission has adopted Regulation E, which is described below.
    Exemption from registration under Section 3(b) or 3(c) of the
 Act does not carry any exemption from the provisions of the Act
 prohibiting fraudulent conduct in the offer or sale of securities and
 imposing civil liability or criminal responsibility for such conduct.
Exempt OHerings Under Regulation A
    Regulation A permits a company to obtain capital not in excess of
 $300,000 (including underwriting commissions) in anyone year from
 a public offering of its securities without registration, provided speci-
 fied conditions are met. These include the filing of a notification
 supplying basic information about the company with the Regional
 Office of the Commission in the region in which the company has its
principal place of business, and the filing and use in the offering of
an offering circular. However, an offering circular need not be filed
or used in connection with an offering not in excess of $50,000 by a
company with earnings in one of the last 2 years.
   During the 1970 fiscal year, 1104 notifications were filed under
Regulation A, covering proposed offerings of $293,666,784,compared
with 1043 notifications covering proposed offerings of $267,074,784in
the 1969 fiscal year.

  18 A bill (S. 336) which raises the maximum to $500,000 was enacted in Decem-

ber 1970. See p. 19, 8upra.

   Reports of Sales.-Regulation A provides that within 30 days
after the end of each 6-month period following the date of the origi-
nal offering circular required by Rule 256, or the statement required
by Rule 257, the issuer or other person for whose account the securi-
ties are offered must file a report of sales containing specified infor-
mation. A final report must be filed upon complqtion or termination
of the offering.
   During the fiscal year 1970,1394 reports of sales were filed report-
ing aggregate sales of $116,399,452.
   Suspension of Exemption.-The          Commission may suspend an
exemption under Regulation A where, in general, the exemption is
sought for securities for which the regulation provides no exemption
or where the offering is not made in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the regulation or with prescribed disclosure standards.
Following the issuance of a temporary suspension order by the Com-
mission, the respondents may request a hearing to determine whether
the temporary suspension should be vacated or made permanent. If
no hearing is requested within 30 days after the entry of the tempo-
rary suspension order and none is ordered by the Commission on its
o m motion, the temporary suspension order becomes permanent.
   During the 1970 fiscal year, temporary suspension orders were is-
sued in 29 cases, which, added to the 8 cases pending at the begin-
ning of the fiscal year, resulted in a total of 37 cases for disposition.
Of these, the temporary suspension order became permanent in 18
cases: in 11 by lapse of time, in 6 by withdrawal of a r q u & for
hearing, and in 1 by acceptance of an offer of settlement. The re-
maining 19 cases were pending at the end of the fiscal year.

   Reports of sales.-The      Commission requires persons who make
offerings under Regulation B to file reports of the actual sales made
pursuant to that regulation. The purpose of these reports is to aid
the Commission in determining whether violations of laws have oc-
curred in the marketing of such securities. The following table
shows the number of sales reports filed under Regulation B during
the past 3 fiscal years and the aggregate dollar amount of sales dur-
ing each of such fiscal years.

Exempt Offerings Under Regulation E
  Regulation E provides a conditional exemption from registration
under the Securities Act for securities of small business investment
companies which are licensed under the Small Business Investment
Act of 1958 or which have received the preliminary approval of the
Small Business Administration and have been notified by the Ad-
ministration that they may submit an application for such a license.
  The regulation, which is similar in many respects to the general
40            SECURITIES   AND EXCHANGE      COMMISSION

exemption provided by Regulation A, requires the filing of a notifi-
cation with the Commission and, except in the case of offerings not
in excess of $50,000, the filing and use of an offering circular con-
taining certain specified information.
   Regulation E also authorizes the Commission to suspend an ex-
emption, substantially on the same grounds as those specified in
Regulation A.
   No notifications were filed under Regulation E during the 1970
fiscal year.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation F
   Regulation F provides an exemption for assessments levied upon
assessable stock and for delinquent assessment sales in amounts not
exceeding $300,000 in anyone year. It requires the filing of a simple
notification giving brief information with respect to the issuer, its
management, principal security holders, recent and proposed assess-
ments and other security issues. The regulation requires a company
to send to its stockholders, or otherwise publish, a statement of the
purposes for which the proceeds of the assessment are proposed to
be used. Copies of any other sales literature used in connection with
the assessment must be filed. Like Regulation A, Regulation F pro-
vides for the suspension of an exemption thereunder where the regu-
lation provides no exemption or where the offering is not made in ac-
cordance with the terms and conditions of the regulation or in
accordance with prescribed disclosure standards.
   During the 1970 fiscal year, 19 notifications were filed under Regu-
lation F, covering assessments of $498:220, compared with 18 notifi-
cations covering assessments of $492,076 filed in the 1969 fiscal year.
These notifications were filed in three of the nine regional offices of
the Commission: Denver, San Francisco and Seattle. Underwriters
were not employed in any of the Regulation F assessments. No Reg-
ulation F exemption was suspended during the fiscal year.
            B. CONTINUING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS
   The Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, contains a
number of significant disclosure provisions with respect to securities
traded in the securities markets. These provisions, applicable in gen-
eral to issuers of securities listed on exchanges and issuers of securi-
ties traded over-the-counter which meet minimum asset and number
of stockholder tests, include requirements for the registration of se-
curities with the Commission and for periodic reports, as well as for
                       THIRTY-SIXTH      ANNUAL REPORT                        41
appropriate disclosure in connection with the exercise of stockhold-
ers' voting rights, takeover bids and insiders' securities transactions.
Registration of Securities on Exchanges
   Unless a security is registered on a national securities exchange
under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act or is exempt from regis-
tration, it is unlawful for a member of such exchange or any broker
or dealer to effect any transaction in the security on the exchange. In
general, the Act exempts from registration obligations issued or
guaranteed by a State or the Federal Government or by certain sub-
divisions or agencies thereof and authorizes the Commission to
adopt rules and regulations exempting such other securities as the
Commission may find necessary or appropriate to exempt in the
public interest or for the protection of investors. Under this author-
ity the Commission has exempted securities of certain banks, certain
securities secured by property or leasehold interests, certain war-
rants and, on a temporary basis, certain securities issued in substitu-
tion for or in addition to listed securities.
   Pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, an issuer may,
if it meets the requirements of the exchange, register a class of securi-
ties on an exchange by filing with the Commission and the exchange
an application which discloses pertinent information concerning the
issuer and its affairs. Information must be furnished regarding the
issuer's business, its capital structure, the terms of its securities, the
persons who manage or control its affairs, the remuneration paid to
its officers and directors, and the allotment of options, bonuses and
profit-sharing plans. Financial statements certified by an independent
accountant must be filed as purt of the application.
   Form 10 is the form used for registration by most commercial and
industrial cornpanies.> There are specialized forms for certain types
of securities, such as voting trust certificates, certificates of deposit
and securities of foreign governments.
   Statistics regarding securities traded on exchanges may be found
in Part III of this report and in Appendix Tables 4-9.
Registration of Over-the-Counter Securities
  Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act requires a company with total
assets exceeding $1 million and a class of equity securities held of
record by 500 or more persons to register those securities with the
Commission, unless one of the exemptions set forth in that section is

available," or the Commission issues an exemptive order under Sec-
tion 12(h).
   During the fiscal year, 1,157 registration statements were filed
under Section 12(g). This makes a total, from the enactment of Sec-
tion 12(g) in 1964, through June 30, 1970, of 4,976 registration
statements filed. Nine of these statements were withdrawn before
they had become effective upon determination that they were not re-
quired to be filed under the Act.
   Of the 1,157 registration statements filed under Section 12(g) in
fiscal year 1970, 670 were filed by issuers already subject to the re-
porting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Act. The latter
figure includes 28 registration statements filed by issuers with an-
other security registered on a national securities exchange, and 642
filed by issuers subject to the reporting requirements of Section
15(d) because they had registered securities under the Securities
Act. These latter companies, however, had not been subject to the
proxy solicitation and other disclosure and insider trading provi-
sions of Sections 14 and 16 of the Exchange Act. The remaining 487
issuers which filed registration statements had not been subject to
any of the disclosure or insider trading provisions and became sub-
ject to them through registration.
   Exemptions From Registration.-Section           12(h) of the Act
authorizes the Commission, either by rules and regulations or by
order upon application of an interested person, to grant a complete
or partial exemption from the provisions of Sections 12(g), 13, 14,
15(d), or 16 if the Commission finds that because of the number of
public investors, the amount of trading interest in the securities, the
nature and extent of the activities of the issuer, the income or assets
of the issuer, or otherwise, the exemption is not inconsistent with the
public interest or the protection of investors.
   At the beginning of the fiscal year 8 applications were pending
and 5 were filed during the year. Of these 13 applications, 2 were
withdrawn and 2 were granted. The remaining 9 applications were
pending at the end of the fiscal year.
Periodic Reports
   Section 13 of the Exchange Act requires issuers of securities regis-
tered pursuant to Section 12(b) or 12(g) to file periodic reports
keeping current the information contained in the application for

   20 Section 12 (g) contains various exemptive provisions with respect to cer-
tain types of securities. Of particular significance are the provisions relating
to securities issued by insurance companies and securities of foreign issuers.

13--14, respectively.

rcgistration or rcgistration statement. T h e periodic reports include
annual, semi-aimual, and currelit reports. The principal annual re-
port form is Form 10-I<, which is designed to give current infor-
mation regarding the mattem covered in the original filing. Semi-
annual reports required to be filed on Form 9-IT are devoted chiefly
to furnishing mid-year financial data. Current reports on Form
8-K are required to be filed for each month in which any of certain
specified events of immediate interest to investors has occurred. A
report on this form deals with matters such as changes in control of
tlie registrant, important acquisitions or dispositions of assets, the
institution or termination of important legal proceedings and impor-
tant changes in the issuer's securities. Certain real estate companies
are required to file quarterly reports on Form 7-K. Section 15(d)
of the Exchange Act, generally speaking, requires issuers which
have registered securities under the Securities Act of 1933 and
which have no securities registered under Section 12 to file the re-
ports described above.z1
   The following table shoms the number of reports filed during the
fiscal year pursuant to Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
As of June 30, 1970, there were 2,980 issuers having securities listed
on a national securities exchange and registered under Section 12(b)
of the Act, 3,963 issuers having securities registered under Section
12(g), and 2,414 additional issuers which-were subject to the report-
ing requirements of Section 15(d) of the Act.

Administrative Proceedings To Obtain Compliance With Exchange Act
  Registration or Reporting Requirements
  Section 15(c) (4) of the Exchange Act empowers the Commission
to h d , after notice and opportunity for hearing, that any person
subject to the provisions of Section 12,13 or 15(d) of the Act or the
rules thereunder has failed in any material respect to comply wit11
any of those provisions. It thus provides an administrative proce-

 dure, similar to that provided by Section 19(a) (2) of the Act with
 respect to proceedings to delist securities, for apprising investors of
 materially misleading filings and for the resolution of accounting
 and other complex and technical questions involving the disclosure
provisions of the Act. Under Section 15(c) (4) the Commission can
publish its findings and issue an order requiring compliance and,
when the circumstances of a particular case so warrant, apply to a
U.S. district court for enforcement of its order.
   At the beginning of the fiscal year, two proceedings pursuant to
Section 15(c) (4) of the Securities Exchange Act were pending and
during the year one additional proceeding was instituted. The Com-
mission issued decisions in two of the proceedings during the year
and issued a decision in the third proceeding shortly after the end
of the year.
   The Susquehanna Oorporation 22 involved the adequacy of disclo-
sure contained in a Schedule 13D statement filed by Susquehanna in
connection with its tender offer to purchase common stock of Pan
American Sulphur Company. This was the first administrative pro-
ceeding arising out of the "Takeover Bid Bill" enacted in July
1968.23
   In response to a requirement that the tender offeror disclose any
plans to make a major change in the business of the target company,
the schedule stated, among other things, that
      "Susquehanna does not plan or propose to liquidate Pan American, to sell
      its assets to, or merge it With, any other person, or to make any other
      major change in its business or corporate structure. However, if, at some
      subsequent time, it should appear the interests of the Pan American stock-
      holders would be better served by any of the foregoing courses of action,
      Susquehanna may propose or adopt such course."
   The Commission found this statement to be materially false and
misleading in failing to disclose that at the time of filing Susque-
hanna planned, upon acquiring control, to use the assets of Pan
American to effect acquisitions or mergers. The Commission ordered
Susquehanna to amend its Schedule 13D statement to disclose such
plan. An amended statement was subsequently filed.
   The other two cases were disposed of on the basis of offers of set-
tlement, under which the respective companies consented to findings
that reports filed by them with the Commission were misleading and
otherwise deficient, and agreed to correct such reports and to advise
their shareholders of the proceedings. In Great Northern M anage-

 ment Oompany, Inc.,24 the Commission found that annual reports on
 Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 1965 and 1966 and a
 current report on Form 8-K for October 1967 which were filed by
 Great Northern (registrant) were materially misleading and defi-
 cient, in that they failed adequately or accurately to disclose that reg-
istrant's initial capitalization had consisted in part of debt obliga-
 tions which were to be repaid out of the proceeds of the public sale
 of registrant's stock purportedly offered by selling stockholders;
 that registrant had made public offerings of unregistered securities
and incurred contingent liabilities thereby; that a purportedly unaf-
filiated company had been organized and dominated by persons in
control of registrant and used to sell registrant's stock; and that
proceeds from such sales and other funds derived from registrant
were used by such controlling persons to purchase, through nominees
and another purportedly unaffiliated company in fact controlled by
the same persons, shares of another issuer. The Commission con-
cluded that no further action by it was necessary because Great
Northern had filed correcting amendments to its reports.
    In Federated Purchaser, Ino.,25 the Commission found among
other things that an annual report on Form 10-K filed by Feder-
ated was misleading and deficient in that it contained a certified bal-
ance sheet showing substantial value for a promissory note received
from an affiliated company in exchange for assets carried at no
value and failed to disclose that the basis on which the accountants
certified such balance sheet had ceased to exist prior to the filing of
the report. The Commission ordered Federated to file correcting
amendments and to send copies of its Findings, Opinion and Order
to all shareholders.
Proxy   Solicitations
   Scope and Nature of Proxy ReguIation.-Regulation       14A under
the Exchange Act, implementing Section 14(a) of that Act, governs the
manner in which proxies or other authorizations may be solicited
from the holders of securities registered under Section 12 of that
Act, whether for the election of directors, approval of other corpo-
rate action, or some other purpose." It requires that in any such so-
licitation, whether by the management or minority groups, disclo-

46            SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

 sure must be made of all material facts concerning the matters on
 which security holders are asked to vote, and they must be afforded
 an opportunity to vote "yes" or "no" on each matter other than elec-
 tions. The regulation also provides, among other things, that where
 the management is soliciting proxies, a security holder desiring to
 communicate with other security holders may require the manage-
 ment to furnish him with a list of all security holders or to mail his
 communication to security holders for him. A security holder may
 also, subject to certain limitations, require the management to in-
 clude in its proxy material any appropriate proposal which he wants
 to submit to a vote of security holders. Any security holder or group
 of security holders may at any time make an independent proxy so-
 licitation upon compliance with the proxy rules, whether or not the
 management is making a solicitation. Certain additional provisions
 of the regulation apply where a contest for control of the manage-
 ment of an issuer or representation on the board is involved.
    Copies of proposed proxy material must be filed with the Commis-
 sion in preliminary form prior to the date of the proposed solicita-
 tion. Where preliminary material fails to meet the prescribed
 disclosure standards, the management or other group responsible for
its preparation is notified informally and given an opportunity to
correct the deficiencies in the preparation of the definitive proxy ma-
terial to be furnished to security holders.
    Under Section 14(c) of the Act, issuers of securities registered
under Section 12 must, in accordance with rules and regulations pre-
scribed by the Commission, transmit information comparable to
proxy material to security holders from whom proxies are not solic-
ited. with respect to a stockholders' meeting. Regulation 14C imple-
ments this provision by setting forth the requirements for "informa-
tion statements."
    Statistics Relating to Proxy and Information Statements.-During
the 1970 fiscal year, 5,595 proxy statements in definitive form were
filed, 5,581 by management and 14 by nonmanagement groups or in-
dividual stockholders. In addition, 114 information statements were
filed. The proxy and information statements related to 5,390 compa-
nies, some 319 of which had a second solicitation during the year,
generally for a special meeting not involving the election of direc-
tors.
   There were 5,095 solicitations of proxies for the election of direc-
tors, 487 for special meetings not involving the election of directors,
and 13 for assents and authorizations.

    Stockholders' Proposals.-During      the 1970 fiscal year, 241
proposals submitted by 25 stockholders were included in the proxy
statements of 150 companies under Rule 14a-8 of Regulation 14A.
   Typical of such stockholder proposals submitted to a vote of secu-
rity holders were resolutions relating to amendments to charters or
by-laws to provide for cumulative voting for the election of direc-
tors, preemptive rights, limitations on the grant of stock options to
and their exercise by key employees and management groups, the
sending of a post-meeting report to all stockholders, and limitations
on charitable contributions.
   A total of 52 additional proposals submitted by 24 stockholders
was omitted from the proxy statements of 31 companies in accord-
ance with Rule 14a-8. The principal reasons for such omissions and
the number of times each such reason was involved (counting only
one reason for omission for each proposal even though it may have
been omitted under more than one provision of Rule 14a-8) were as

   Ratio of Soliciting to Nonsoliciting Companies.-Of         the 2,980
issuers that had securities listed and registered on national securities
exchanges as of June 30, 1970, 2,732 had voting securities so listed
48                 SECURITIES      AJ.'I"DEXCHANGE COMMISSION

and registered. Of these 2,732 issuers, 2,48G,or 91 percent, solicited
proxies under the Commission's proxy rules during the 1970 fiscal
year for the election of directors.
   Proxy Contests.-During the 1970 fiscal year, 24 companies were
involved in proxy contests for the election of directors. A total of
550 persons, both management and non-management, filed detailed
statements as participants under the requirements of Rule 14a-ll.
Proxy statements in 20 cases involved contests for control of the
board of directors and those in 4 cases involved contests for repre-
sentation on the board.
   Management retained control in 9 of the 20 contests for control of
the board of directors, 2 were settled by negotiation, non-manage-
ment persons won 3, and 6 were pending as of June 30, 1970. Of the
four cases where representation on the board of directors was in-
volved, management retained all places on the board in one contest
and opposition won places on the board in three cases.
   Litigation Relating to Proxy Rules.- Two recent judicial decisions
have important implications with respect to private actions insti-
tuted to enforce duties arising under the proxy rules that the Com-
mission has promulgated pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act.
   In Mills v. The Electric Auto-Lite UO.,21 a misleading proxy state-
ment was found to have been issued to Auto-Lite shareholders in an
attempt to induce them to vote for a merger of Auto-Lite with Mer-
genthaler Linotype Company. 'Vith regard to the determination con-
cerning a "causal relationship of the proxy material and the
merger," which is required under J. I. Case 00. v. Bomlc,28 the Su-
preme Court held:
      Where there has been a finding of materiality, a shareholder has made a
      sufficient showing of causal relationship between the violation and the in-
      jury for which he seeks redress if, as here, he proves that the proxy solici-
      tation itself, rather than the particular defect in the solicitation materials,
      was an essential link in the accomplishment of the transaction."29
   The Court, as urged by the Commission, amicus curiae, rejected
the holding of the court of appeals that if the defendants could
prove that the terms of the merger were fair, there could be no lia-
bility, although the Court noted in regard to the appropriate relief
that the fairness of the merger terms may be an important factor.so
In this connection the Court held, in accordance with the Commis-
sion's suggestion, that violation of the Commission's proxy rules to

 effect shareholder approval of a proposed merger does not neces-
 sarily require that the merger be voided. 1iVhilesuch relief was not
 ruled out, the Court reiterated its statement in Borak that the lower
 courts are "to be alert to provide such remedies as are necessary to
make effective the congressional purpose." 31 The Court also adopted
the Commission's recommendation that proof of violation of the
proxy rules entitled the plaintiff to an interim award of litigation
expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees.32
   Shortly after the close of the fiscal year, the Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit decided a case affecting the reme-
dies available to a shareholder where a corporate management has
refused to include in the company's proxy statement a proposal
timely submitted by the shareholder pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under
the Securities Exchange Act. A determination by the Commission
not to take enforcement action with respect to such a matter was
held to be partially subject to judicial review in Medical Committee
for Human Rights v, S.E.O.33 The Medical Committee, a share-
holder of the Dow Chemical Company, had requested Dow to submit
to its shareholders a resolution concerning its sale of napalm. In ac-
cordance with Rule 14a-8(d) Dow had advised the Medical Com-
mittee and the Commission's staff that it did not intend to include
the Committee's proposal in its proxy statement since it did not be-
lieve that it was required to do so. After the Commission's staff indi-
cated that it concurred in Dow's legal analysis, the Commission, at
the Committee's request, considered whether enforcement action
would be appropriate should the company omit the proposal from
the proxy materials. The Commission determined that it "would
raise no objection" if the proposal were omitted; it did not articu-
late any basis for its decision or express any view on the merits of
its staff's legal interpretation.
   The court of appeals rejected the Commission's contention that be-
cause no order had been entered the court lacked jurisdiction of a
petition for review. Instead, it took the position that the Committee
had been compelled to bring its controversy with Dow to the Com-
mission and to exhaust whatever administrative remedies were avail-
able and that an adverse decision by the Commission on the merits
could be determinative should the Committee subsequently seek to

  31396 U.S. at 386, quoting 377 US. at 433, 434.
  32 Since the question of ultimate relief was not before the Court, the Court
declined to express a view on the Commission's additional suggestion that
plaintiffs also be reimbursed for the litigation expenses and attorneys' fees to
be incurred in litigating the question of relief.

litigate its dispute with Dow in the district court. Primarily because
of this analysis, and because the court found the Commission's pro-
cedures to be sufficiently formal and adversary in character, it held
that the determination by the Commission was reviewable to the ex-
tent that it embodied a view of the legal merits of Dow's position.
After offering extensive dicta on the meaning of the Commission's
shareholder-proposal rules, the court remanded the matter to the
Commission for an exposition of the rationale behind the Commis-
sion's determination to take no action in the circumstances.
   The court of appeals thereafter denied the Commission's petition
for rehearing, which suggested that no procedures existed to be ex-
hausted and that the kind of decision made by the Commission was
not of a character entitled to significant deference in judicial pro-
ceedings.
Disclosure in Connection With Takeover    Bids and Other Large Acquisitions
    Sections 13(d) and (e) and 14(d), (e) and (f) of the Securities
 Exchange Act, which were enacted in July 1968, as implemented by
 temporary rules and regulations adopted by the Commission, pro-
 vide among other things for full disclosure in connection with cash
 tender offers and other stock acquisitions which may cause a shift in
 control. These provisions were designed to close gaps in the full dis-
 closure provisions of the securities laws and to safeguard the inter-
 ests of persons who tender their securities in response to a tender
 offer.84
    Rule 13d-l under the Act requires the filing with the Commission
 of a Schedule 13D report by a person or group which acquires any
 of a class of equity securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of
the Act or issued by a closed-end investment company registered
 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, if such acquisition re-
sults in the ownership by such person or group of more than 10 per-
cent of such class of securities. During the 1970 fiscal year 291
Schedule 13D acquisition reports were filed. Rule 14d-l requires the
filing of a Schedule 13D report by a person or group making a
tender offer (other than an exchange offer pursuant to a registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933) which, if successful,
would result in such person or group owning more than 10 percent
of any class of equity securities subject to Section 14(d). Thirty-
four Schedule 13D tender offer notices were filed during the fiscal
year.
   In addition, 27 Schedule 14D reports were filed pursuant to Rule
14d-4 involving solicitations or recommendations in connection
  84 Legislation to enlarge the coverage of these provisions   (S. 3431) was
enacted in December 1970. See pp. 19-20, supra.
                     THIRTY-SIXTH     ANNUAL REPORT                       51
 with a tender offer by other than the maker of the offer, and 10
 statements were filed pursuant to Rule 14£-1. The latter relate to the
 replacement of a majority of the board of directors otherwise than
 by stockholder vote pursuant to an arrangement or understanding
 with the person or persons acquiring securities in a transaction sub-
 ject to Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the Act. One statement was filed
pursuant to Rule 13e-1 relating to corporate reacquisitions of secu-
rities while the issuer is the target of a cash tender offer.
    In a related area the Commission during the fiscal year adopted
Rule 10b-13,35which prohibits a person making a cash tender offer
or an exchange offer from purchasing equity securities of the same
class (or any other security immediately convertible into or ex-
changeable for that security) during the period after the announce-
ment of a tender or exchange offer until the close of the tender or
exchange period, otherwise than pursuant to the offer itself. The
Commission pointed out that other purchases were often fraudulent
and manipulative in nature and could deceive the investing public as
to the true state of affairs, and it stated that the rule would safe-
guard the interests of persons who have tendered their securities in
response to a cash tender or exchange offer.
Insiders' Security Holdings and Transactions
    Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act and corresponding pro-
 visions in Section 17 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
 1935 and Section 30(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 are
 designed to provide other stockholders and investors generally with
information as to insiders' securities transactions and holdings, and
to prevent the unfair use of confidential information by insiders to
profit from short-term trading in a company's securities.
    Ownership Reports.-8ection     16(a) of the Exchange Act requires
every person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, more than
10 percent of any class of equity security which is registered under
Section 12, or who is a director or an officer of the issuer of any
such security, to file statements with the Commission disclosing the
amount of all equity securities of the issuer of which he is the bene-
ficial owner and changes in such ownership. Copies of such state-
ments must also be filed with exchanges on which securities are
listed. Similar provisions applicable to insiders of registered public-
utility holding companies and registered closed-end investment com-
panies are contained in Section 17(a) of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act and Section 30(£) of the Investment Company Act.86

52                    SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

   During the fiscal year, 95,952 ownership reports (21,337 initial
statements of ownership on Form 3 and 74,615statements of changes
in ownership on Form 4) were filed with the Commission. By com-
parison, during fiscal year 1969, 93,708 such reports were filed
 (16,036initial statements and 77,672statements of changes).
   All ownership reports are made available for public inspection as
soon as they are filed at the Commission's officein Washington and
at the exchanges where copies are filed. In addition, the information
contained in reports filed with the Commission is summarized and
published in the monthly "Official Summary of Security Transac-
tions and Holdings", which is distributed by the Government Print-
ing Officeto more than 20,000subscribers.
   Recovery of Short-Swing Trading Profits.- In order to prevent
insiders from making unfair use of information which they may have
obtained by reason of their relationship with a company, Section
16(b) of the Exchange Act, Section 17(b) of the Holding Company
Act, and Section 30(f) of the Investment Company Act provide for
the recovery by or on behalf of the issuer of any profit realized by
insiders (in the categories listed above) from certain purchases and
sales, or sales and purchases, of securities of the company within
any period of less than 6 months. The Commission at times partici-
pates as amicus curiae in actions to recover such profits when it
deems it important to present its views regarding the interpretation
of the statutory provisions or of the exemptive rules adopted by the
Commission thereunder.
Investigations With Respect to Reporting and Proxy Provisions
   Sections 21(a) of the Exchange Act authorizes the Commission to
make such investigations as it deems necessary to determine whether
any person has violated or is about to violate any provision of the
Act or any rule or regulation thereunder. The Commission is author-
ized, for this purpose, to administer oaths, subpoena witnesses, com-
pel their attendance, take evidence and require the production of re-
cords. The following investigations were undertaken pursuant to
Section 21(a) in connection with the enforcement of the reporting
provisions of Sections 12, 13, 14 and 15(d) of the Act and the rules
thereunder, particularly those provisions relating to the filing of an-
nual and other periodic reports and proxy material:

Summary Suspension of Trading
   Section 19(a) (4) of the Exchange Act authorizes the Commission
to suspend summarily exchange trading in a security listed on a na-
tional securities exchange for up to 10 days if in its opinion the
public interest so requires. Under Section 15(c) (5) of that Act the
Commission may summarily suspend over-the-counter trading in any
non-exempt security for up to 10 days if it believes that such action
is required in the public interest and for the protection of investors.
   During the 1970 fiscal year, the Commission temporarily sus-
pended trading in 55 securities, compared to 33 in fiscal 1969 and 39
in fiscal 1968. In seven instances, exchange-listed securities were
involved;" In each of these cases, the exchange on which the securi-
ties were listed had previously halted trading.
   As in the past, the principal ground for suspension in most in-
stances was the unavailability to investors of accurate and complete
information concerning the issuer and its securities. Other grounds
for suspension included dissemination of inaccurate and misleading
financial information, a need for clarification of certain corporate
events, and investors' need to be apprised of a Commission-instituted
court action.
   A number of the suspensions involved the securities of "shell" cor-
porations-eompanies which are essentially defunct, with no assets
or earnings." On several occasions, the Commission announced the
suspension of trading in a number of securities of "shells" simulta-
neously, when it appeared that the "shells" were being reactivated
by promoters who circulated inadequate and inaccurate information
concerning them."
   The suspensions involved a wide variety of factual circumstances.
In the case of Arkansas Valley Industries, Inc., the suspension was
ordered at the request of the company so that it could issue a state-
ment to clarify the extent of the impact of a U.S. Department of
Agriculture announcement," The Department had announced that it
had found pesticide residues in turkeys produced by Arkansas Val-
ley; that it was not allowing the marketing of turkeys and turkey

  products either known or suspected to contain this pesticide; and that
  it was investigating whether live turkeys had also been contami-
  nated.
     In the case of Professional Health Services, the Commission sus-
  pended trading by reason of the absence of complete and accurate
  information about the company and to provide an opportunity for
  the dissemination of clarifying information prior to the resumption
  of trading. Certain New York State agencies had declined to pay
 Medicaid claims factored by that company, which had been listed as
  a major part of the company's receivables. Further, the company
  and certain of its principals had been indicted for violations of and
  conspiracy to violate Sections 5(b) and 17(a) of the Securities Act,
 the indictment alleging the use of false and misleading statements in
 a prospectus used in the company's public stock offering."
    The temporary suspension of over-the-counter trading in the se-
 curities of Health Evaluation Systems, Inc.42 was ordered because of
 the inadequacy of available information about the issuer and because
 of a recent, rapid rise in the price of the common stock which, ac-
 cording to management, was not justified by any developments in
 the business or by any improved prospects for the corporation. A
 foreign-based mutual fund had purchased in a short period of time
 about one-half of all publicly traded Health Evaluation System
 shares, which apparently created the substantial rise in the price of
 the stock. The company, which purported to be engaged in provid-
 ing health examinations through the use of instruments, technicians
 and nurses rather than medical doctors, reported that it had little
revenue and was currently operating at a loss.
    During the fiscal year, several injunctive proceedings and criminal
actions were instituted involving securities which had been the sub-
ject of trading suspensions."
    Commission releases announcing the terminations of trading sus-
pensions frequently carry a warning to investors to exercise care in
transactions involving the securities in question, and remind brokers
and dealers of their responsibilities under the Federal securities laws
for full disclosure of all material facts in connection with the execu-
tion of securities transactions.
                 C. ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING              MATTERS

   The several Acts administered by the Commission reflect a recog-
nition by Congress that dependable financial statements of a com-

 42   Securities Exchange Act Release No. 8913 (June 25,1970).

                    THIRTY-SIXTH    ANNUAL REPORT                     55
   pany are indispensable to an informed investment decision regarding
   its securities. The value of such statements is directly dependent 011
   the soundness of the judgment exercised in applying accounting
  principles and practices in their preparation, and on the adequacy
  and reliability of the work done by public accountants who certify
  the statements. A major objective of the Commission has been to im-
  prove accounting and auditing standards and to assist in the estab-
  lishment and maintenance of high standards of professional conduct
  by certifying accountants. The primary responsibility for this pro-
  gram rests with the Chief Accountant of the Commission.
      Pursuant to the Commission's broad rulemaking power regarding
  the preparation and presentation of financial information, it has
  adopted a basic accounting regulation (Regulation S-X) which, to-
 gether with opinions on accounting principles published as "Ac-
  counting Series Releases," governs the form and content of financial
  statements filed under the statutes administered by the Commission.
 The Commission has also formulated rules with respect to account-
 ing for and auditing of brokers and dealers and has prescribed uni-
  form systems of accounts for companies subject to the Public Utility
 Holding Company Act of 1935. The accounting rules and the opin-
 ions of the Commission and its decisions in particular cases have
 contributed to clarification and wider acceptance of the accounting
 principles and practices and auditing standards developed by the
 profession and generally followed in the preparation of financial
 statements.
     The rules and regulations thus established, except for the uniform
 systems of accounts which are regulatory reports, prescribe account-
 ing principles to be followed only in certain limited areas. In the
large area of financial reporting not covered by its rules, the Com-
 mission's principal means of protecting investors from inadequate or
 improper financial reporting is by requiring a certificate of an inde-
pendent public accountant, based on an audit performed in accord-
 ance with generally accepted auditing standards, which expresses an
opinion whether the financial statements are presented fairly in con-
 formity with accounting principles and practices which are recog-
nized as sound and which have attained general acceptance. The re-
quirement that the opinion be rendered by an independent
accountant is designed to secure for the benefit of public investors the
detached objectivity of a knowledgeable professional person not con-
nected with the management.
     The accounting staff examines the financial statements filed with
the Commission to insure that the required standards are observed
and that the accounting and auditing procedures do not remain static
 56            SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

 in the face of changes and new developments in financial and eco-
 nomic conditions. New methods of doing business, the formation of
 new types of business, the large number of combinations of old busi-
 nesses, the use of more sophisticated securities, and other innovations,
 create accounting problems which require a constant reappraisal of
 the procedures.
 Relations With the Accounting Profession and the Public
    In order to keep abreast of such changes and new developments
 and in recognition of the need for a continuous exchange of views
 and information between the Commission's staff and outside accoun-
 tants regarding appropriate accounting and auditing policies, proce-
 dures and practices for the protection of investors, the staff main-
 tains continuing contact with individual accountants, other
 government agencies, and various professional organizations. These
 include the American Accounting Association, the American Insti-
 tute of Certified Public Accountants, the American Petroleum Insti-
 tute, the Financial Analysts Federation, the Financial Executives
 Institute, the National Association of Accountants, and the National
 Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners. Since the
 American Institute of Certified Public Accountants is the principal
 professional organization involved in the development and improve-
 ment of accounting and auditing standards and practices, regular li-
 aison is maintained with it through its Committee on Relations with
 Securities and Exchange Commission and Stock Exchanges. Confer-
 ences are held from time to time at which the staff is briefed on the
 work being done by the Institute's Committees on Ethics and Audit-
ing Procedures and the Accounting Principles Board and problems
of mutual interest are discussed. The Commission's accounting staff
also meets with the Committee on Corporate Reporting of the Fi-
nancial Executives Institute to coordinate efforts toward the im-
provement of standards.
   As part of the Commission's effort to maintain a continuing ex-
change of views with the accounting profession, the Chairman, other
Commissioners, the Chief Accountant and other members of the
accounting staff from time to time address, or participate in panel
discussions at, professional society meetings. In this way the Com-
mission can indicate problem areas in accounting where it believes
the profession can aid in developing solutions. As an example, both
the Chairman and the Chief Accountant urged the profession to re-
study the accounting principles applicable to business acquisitions or
combinations in order to develop criteria which will prevent abuses
arising from inadequate restrictions on the choice between the alter-
natives of purchase or pooling-of-interests accounting to be accorded
                      THIRTY-SIXTH     ANNUAL REPORT                        57
such transactions. (The Chairman also commented on this matter in
testimony before Committees of the Congress.") The Chief Accoun-
tant also accepts engagements to explain the work of the Commis-
sion at colleges and universities throughout the country.
  Because of its many foreign registrants and the vast and increas-
ing foreign operations of American companies, the Commission has
an interest in the improvement of accounting and auditing princi-
ples and procedures on an international basis. To promote such im-
provement the Chief Accountant corresponds with foreign accoun-
tants, interviews many who visit this country, and, on occasion,
participates in foreign accounting conferences or writes for foreign
professional journals. In September 1970 he presented a paper at the
First Annual Conference of the British Accounting and Finance As-
sociation in Edinburgh, Scotland.
The Work of the Accounting Principles Board and Committees of the AICPA
   The Accounting Principles Board sponsors research studies of
problem areas in accounting and formulates formal opinions and ad-
 visory statements for the improvement of accounting standards and
 practices. The advisory statements contain recommendations of the
 Board which companies may adopt voluntarily. In furtherance of
the policy of cooperation between professional organizations and the
Commission, the Board submits drafts of these studies, opinions and
statements to the Chief Accountant for review and comment prior to
publication, and representatives of the Board confer with him on
projects in progress or under consideration. Standing committees of
the AICP A develop statements on auditing standards and proce-
dures for the guidance of the profession in much the same manner
that APB opinions are developed.
   In July 1969 the Board issued a Statement on "Financial State-
ments Restated for General Price-Level Changes" in which the bene-
fits of such statements when presented on a supplemental basis are
discussed, but which recommends against their substitution for the
basic historical dollar financial statements. The Board issued expo-
sure drafts of two opinions in February 1970 entitled "Accounting
Methods and Estimates" and "Business Combinations and Intangible
Assets." It adopted separate definitive opinions on "Business Combi-
nations" and "Intangible Assets" in July 1970.
   Other topics on which the Board or its subcommittees are working
with a view to issuing opinions are: the equity method of account-

   44 SUbcommittee on Antitrust  and Monopoly of the Senate Committee on the
.Judiciary, February 18, 1970; Antitrust Subcommittee of the Committee on the
.Judiciary of the House of Representatives, May 14, 1970; .Joint Economic Com-
mittee of the United States Congress, .July 10, 1970.
 58            SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

  ing for intercorporate investments, segmented data in the financial
  statements of diversified companies, capitalization of leases, prepara-
  tion of interim financial statements, and components of a business
  enterprise. Subcommittees are also developing a document pertaining
  to basic concepts and accounting principles underlying financial
  statements of business enterprises and a statement urging that com-
  panies include a statement of their accounting principles in their an-
 nual reports.
     An Accounting Research Study, "Financial Reporting in the Ex-
 tractive Industries,"     was published in November 1969. Other
 research studies are being conducted on the subjects of materiality,
 research and development, foreign operations, stockholder equities,
 asset and liability valuation in income determination, inventory pric-
 ing, and depreciation methods.
    In connection with the development of opinions in major problem
 areas, the Board sponsors symposiums which are attended by repre-
sentatives of all professional groups, including the SEC, concerned
with the particular accounting problems, in order to foster a better
understanding of the problems and agreement on the proposed solu-
tions.
    The AICP A Committee on Bank Accounting and Auditing issued
a supplement to the guide "Audits of Banks" in November 1969
which incorporates specific standards in previously unsettled areas
which were agreed upon by representatives of the banks, the federal
regulatory agencies and the Institute committee.
    The AICP A Committee on Auditing Procedure issued Statements
on Auditing Procedure pertaining to "Subsequent Discovery of
Facts Existing at the Date of the Auditor's Report" and "Reporting
When a Certified Public Accountant is Not Independent" in October
and November 1969, respectively. This committee is also developing a
Statement on Auditing Procedure on "Confirmation of Receivables
and Observation of Inventories."
Other Current Developments
   The Chief Accountant's office has submitted proposed revisions of
Articles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 11 and Rules 12-01 through 12-17 of
Regulation S-X, the Commission's basic accounting regulation, to
certain professional groups for an informal review prior to their
being issued for public comment. These general revisions, the first
since 1950, represent changes, additions or eliminations that have be-
come necessary as a result of changing conditions over the years. A
committee of the AICP A had submitted many helpful suggestions,
and more recently the Commission's Disclosure Study Group recom-
                      THIRTY-SIXTH     ANNUAL     REPORT                    59
  mended certain revisions of Regulation S-X, particularly with re-
  spect to the required schedules.
    The Commission issued a proposal in September 1969 45 to include
 in Regulation S-X a section which would specify the content of a
 statement of source and applications of funds. This proposal re-
 flected recommendations by the Study Group, as well as by the
 AICP A and other professional groups, that such statements be re-
 quired in certain filings made by registrants. At that time the Com-
 mission also issued proposals 46 to require such statements in certain
  registration statements and annual reports filed under the securities
 acts. Following consideration of comments received, the Commission,
 in the fall of 1970,adopted amendments with respect to these matters. 47
    During the fiscal year four Accounting Series Releases were is-
 sued, three of which related to investment companies. One release 48
 dealt with the problems of valuation of restricted securities held by
 registered investment companies. Another release 49 clarified disclo-
 sure requirements concerning restricted securities. These two releases
 are discussed in greater detail in Part V of this report. 50 The third
release 51 announced the adoption of amendments of rules in Regula-
tion S-X and under the Investment Company Act of 1940 with re-
spect to provision by registered investment companies for Federal
income taxes.
    During the fiscal year a number of registration statements were
filed which included accountants' opinions that were qualified re-
garding the registrant's ability to attain profitable operations and/or
successfully to obtain additional capital, matters of such significance
to the registrants that there was a serious question whether the opin-
ions met the Commission's certification requirements. The Commis-
sion issued an Accounting Series Release 52 which specified, in part,
that "an accountant's report cannot meet the certification require-
ments of the 1933 Act unless the registrant can arrange its financial
affairs so that the immediate threat to continuation as a going busi-
ness is removed. The independent accountant must be satisfied that

    D. EXEMPTIONS FOR SECURITIES OF INTERNATIONAL BANKS
 International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
     Section 15 of the Bretton Woods Agreement Act, as amended, ex-
  empts from registration under both the Securities Act and the Se-
  curities Exchange Act securities issued, or guaranteed as to both
  principal and interest, by the International Bank for Reconstruction
  and Development. The Bank is required to file with the Commission
  such annual and other reports with respect to such securities as the
  Commission determines to be appropriate in view of the special
  character of the Bank and its operations, and necessary in the public
  interest or for the protection of investors. Pursuant to this author-
 ity, the Commission has adopted rules requiring the Bank to file
  quarterly reports and also to file copies of each annual report of the
  Bank to its Board of Governors. The Bank is also required to file re-
 ports with the Commission in advance of any distribution in the
 United States of its primary obligations. The Commission, acting in
 consultation with the National Advisory Board on International
 Monetary and Financial Problems, is authorized to suspend the ex-
 emption at any time as to any or all securities issued or guaranteed
 by the Bank during the period of such suspension. The following
 summary of the Bank's activities reflects information obtained from
 the Bank.
    During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1970, the Bank made 69
 loans totaling $1,580 million in 39 countries, compared with a total
 of $1,399 million the previous year. In addition, in fiscal 1970, the
 Bank lent $100 million to its affiliate, the International Finance Cor-
 poration, to assist in financing the Corporation's loans and invest-
ments in private enterprises.
    Net income for the year was a record high of $213 million, a gain
of $41.5 million over net income reported for fiscal 1969. The Bank's
Executive Directors have recommended to its Board of Governors
that $100 million of net income be transferred as a grant to its affil-
iate, the International Development Association. The remainder will
be trans~er:ed to the Bank's Supplemental Reserve, increasing it to
$1,150million. Total reserves of the Bank, including the Special Re-
serve, will amount to $1,442million.
   Gros~ ~co~e for fiscal 1970 aggregated $504 million including
$149 million income from investments, $344 million income from
                    THIRTY-SIXTH    A1\TNUALREPORT                    61
   loans and $11 million income from other sources. As compared to
   the prior year, income from investments was $61 million higher in
   the year as a result of both a higher level of investments and higher
   yields. Income from loans was $30 million higher primarily due to
   expansion of the Bank's loan portfolio. The interest charged on new
   loans increased during the fiscal year from 6% percent to 7 percent.
      Expenses in fiscal 1970 totaled $291 million compared with $239
   million the previous year. Interest on the Bank's own bonds and
   other financial costs amounted to $246 million, an increase of $49
   million over fiscal 1969 reflecting both increased borrowings and
   higher interest rates. Administrative expenses were $4 million higher
   at a total of $45 million, after deduction of $15.8 million in manage-
   ment fees charged to the International Development Association.
     The Bank increased its investments in liquid securities during the
  year by $344 million to an aggregate of $1,720 million at June 30,
  1970. Other liquid investments held in the Bank's Special Reserve,
  on the same date, amounted to $292 million, bringing its liquid se-
  curities to a total of $2,012 million. This compares with a total of
  $1,667million in similar holdings at June 30, 1969.
     Repayments of principal on loans received by the Bank during
  the year amounted to $329 million; and a further $113 million was
  repaid to purchasers of parts of loans. Total principal repayments
 to the Bank through June 30, 1970, aggregated $3,763 million, in-
 cluding $2,126 million repaid to the Bank and $1,637 million repaid
 to purchasers of borrowers' obligations sold by the Bank.
     Outstanding funded debt of the Bank was $-1,568million on June
 30, 1970. During the year the Bank borrowed $349.5million through
 the issuance of 2-year U.S. dollar bonds to Central Banks and other
 governmental agencies in more than 60 countries; 72 billion yen
  (U.S. $200 million), the first sale of Yen obligations by the 'Vorld
 Bank; and DM: 719 million (U.S. $185.5 million) in Germany. The
 Bank also issued $97.6 million of bonds that had been sold pre-
viously under delayed delivery contracts.
    These borrowings, in part, refunded maturing issues amounting to
 the equivalent of $377 million. After the retirement of U.S. $58.8
million equivalent of obligations retired through sinking fund and
purchase fund operations, the Bank's outstanding funded debt
showed an increase of $487 million from the previous year.
    Southern Yemen, Swaziland and the Yemen Arab Republic be-
came members in the year, bringing total membership to 113 coun-
tries on June 30, 1970. The Democratic Republic of Congo, Jamaica
and Nigeria increased their subscriptions to the Bank's capital. On
 62            SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

 June 30, 1970 aggregate subscribed capital of the Bank was $23,158.8
 million of which the equivalent of $2,315.9 million had been paid in
 to the Bank and the remaining $20,842.9 million was subject to call
 only to meet the obligations of the Bank.
 Inter-American Development Bank
     The Inter-American Development Bank Act, which authorizes the
  United States to participate in the Inter-American Development
  Bank, provides an exemption for certain securities which may be is-
 sued or guaranteed by the Bank similar to that provided for securi-
  ties of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
 Acting pursuant to this authority, the Commission adopted Regula-
 tion IA, which requires the Bank to file with the Commission sub-
 stantially the same information, documents and reports as are re-
 quired from the International        Bank for Reconstruction and
 Development. The following summary of the Bank's activities re-
 flects information submitted by the Bank to the Commission.
     During the year ended June 30, 1970, the Bank made 21 loans to-
 taling the equivalent of $223,823,000 from its Ordinary Capital re-
 sources, bringing the net total of loan commitments outstanding,
 after cancellations, to 193, aggregating $1,327,312,073. During the
 year, the Bank sold or agreed to sell $1,166,187 in participations in
 the aforesaid loans, all such participations being without the guar-
 antee of the Bank. The loans from the Bank's Ordinary Capital re-
 sources were made in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador,
 Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela.
    During the year the Bank also made 39 loans totaling the equiva-
lent of $451,660,000from its Fund for Special Operations, bringing
the gross total of loan commitments outstanding to 257, aggregating
$1,807,152,484.The Bank made no loans during the year from the
Social Progress Trust Fund, which it administers under an agree-
ment with the United States, leaving the gross total of loan commit-
ments outstanding from that Fund at 116, aggregating $495,333,014.
    On June 30, 1970, the outstanding funded debt of the Ordinary
Capital resources of the Bank was the equivalent of $774,561,704re-
flecting a net increase in the past year of the equivalent of
$60,490,206.During the year the funded debt was increased through
public bond issues in Austria and Germany, AS 150,000,000 (US
$5,769,000) and DM 100,000,000 (US $27,322,000), respectively, as
well as private placements in Japan, Latin America, Switzerland
and the United Kingdom in the aggregate U.S. equivalent of
$61,389,000. The revaluation of the Deutsche Mark in October 1969
resulted in an increase in the funded debt in the U.S. dollar equiva-
                    THIRTY-SIXTH    ANNUAL REPORT                   63
 lent of $8,825,000. The funded debt was decreased through the re-
 tirement of $25,350,000 of short-term dollar bonds and $17,465,000
 through sinking fund purchases.
    The subscribed ordinary capital of the Bank on June 30, 1970 was
 the equivalent of $2,282,255,000of which $1,893,775,000represented
 callable capital.
 Asian Development Bank
      The Asian Development Bank Act adopted in March 1966 author-
   ized United States participation in the Asian Development Bank
   and provides an exemption for certain securities which may be is-
   sued or guaranteed by the Bank similar to the exemptions accorded
  the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the
  Inter-American Development Bank. Acting pursuant to this authori-
  ty the Commission has adopted Regulation AD which requires the
  Bank to file with the Commission substantially the same informa-
  tion, documents and reports as are required from these Banks. Ap-
   proval during the fiscal year of the applications of Fiji and France
  for membership in the Bank, with subscriptions of $1 million and
  $25 million, respectively, brought the Bank's total membership to 35,
  including 21 countries in the region and 14 nonregional developed
  countries, with subscriptions totaling $1,004 million.
     The fourth of the United States' five $20 million installments on
  its paid-in capital subscription was paid in August 1969 and con-
 sisted of $10 million in cash and $10 million in the form of a non-
 interest-bearing letter of credit which may be drawn on in the fu-
 ture when required by the Bank for disbursement. Of the $489.5
 million subscriptions on paid-in capital for all members as of June
 30, 1970, installments totaling $389.6 million had matured as of that
 date.
     As of June 30, 1970, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Japan, the
 Netherlands and the United Kingdom had offered to contribute a
 total of $159.45 million to the Bank's Special Funds, of which $72.5
million had been made available to the Bank. In addition, the
$14.575 million set aside from Ordinary Capital in 1969 by the
Board of Governors for Special Funds purposes is also available for
such lending. On February 25, 1970, President Nixon submitted to
the Congress a proposal for a $100 million United States contribution
to the Bank's Special Funds over a period of 3 years. The proposed
legislation is pending before the Congress.
    In September 1969 the Bank sold DM 60 million ($15 million) 7
percent Deutsch Mark bonds in the Federal Republic of Germany. In
April 1970 the Bank sold AS 130 million ($5 million) Austrian
64            SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

schilling '[ percent bonds in Austria. As of J Wle 30, 1970, these con-
stituted the Bank's only borrowings.
   During the year ending June 30, 1970, the Asian Development
Bank approved 12 loans amounting to $62.035million from its Ordi-
nary Capital resources and 8 loans amounting to $33.658 million
from its Special Funds resources. This brought the Bank's loans
since its inception to a total of 25 from Ordinary Capital amounting
to $138.435million, and to 9 from Special Funds amounting to $34.648
million. As of June 30, 1970,the Bank had undertaken 27 technical as-
sistance projects in 13 countries, as well as important regional activ-
ities.
                 E. TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939
   This Act requires that bonds, debentures, notes, and similar debt
securities offered for public sale, except as specifically exempted, be
issued under an indenture which meets the requirements of the Act
and has been duly qualified with the Commission.
   The provisions of the Act are closely integrated with the require-
ments of the Securities Act. Registration pursuant to the Securities
Act of securities to be issued under a trust indenture subject to the
Trust Indenture Act is not permitted to become effective unless the
indenture conforms to the requirements of the latter Act designed to
safeguard the rights and interests of the purchasers. Moreover, spec-
ified information about the trustee and the indenture must be in-
cluded in the registration statement.
   The Act was passed after studies by the Commission had revealed
the frequency with which trust indentures failed to provide mini-
mum protections for security holders and absolved so-called trustees
from minimum obligations in the discharge of their trusts. It re-
quires that the indenture trustee be free of conflicting interests
which might interfere with the faithful exercise of its duties in be-
half of the purchasers of the securities. It requires also that the
trustee be a corporation with a minimum combined capital and sur-
plus; imposes high standards of conduct and responsibility on the
trustee; precludes preferential collection of certain claims owing to
the trustee by the issuer in the event of default; provides for the is-
suer's supplying evidence to the trustee of compliance with inden-
ture terms and conditions such as those relating to the release or
substitution of mortgaged property, issuance of new securities or
satisfaction of the indenture; and provides for reports and notices
by the trustee to security holders. Other provisions of the Act pro-
hibit impairment of the security holders' right to sue individually
for principal and interest except under certain circumstances, and

used by them to communicate with each other regarding their rights.

            REGULATION       OF SECURITIES        MARKETS
   In addition to the disclosure provisions discussed in Part II of
this report, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 gives the Commis-
sion significant responsibilities with respect to the securities markets
and persons engaged in the securities business. Among other things,
it requires securities exchanges to register with the Commission and
provides for Commission supervision of the self-regulatory responsi-
bilities conferred on registered exchanges. The Act also provides for
the registration and regulation of brokers and dealers doing business
in the over-the-counter markets, and grants to registered associations
of brokers or dealers self-regulatory functions under the Commission's
supervision. In addition, it contains provisions designed to prevent
fraudulent, deceptive, and manipulative acts and practices on the ex-
changes and in the over-the-counter markets.
   This and the next part of the report deal with developments and
actions taken in these areas during the 1970 fiscal year. Statistical
information concerning the securities markets is presented in this
part. Certain recent developments of particular significance are dis-
cussed in Part I.
                       REGULATION   OF EXCHANGES
Registration and Exemption of Exchanges
   The Securities Exchange Act requires an exchange to be registered
with the Commission as a national securities exchange unless the Com-
mission exempts it from registration because of the limited volume of
transactions effected. As of .Iune 30, 1970, the following 12 stock
exchanges were registered:
American Stock Exchange               New York Stock Exchange
Boston Stock Exchange                 Pacific Coast Stock Exchange
Chicago Board of Trade                Philadelphia-Baltimore-  Washington
Cincinnati Stock Exchange               Stock Exchange
Detroit Stock Exchange                Salt Lake Stock Exchange
Midwest Stock Exchange                Spokane Stock Exchange
National Stock Exchange
  Effective December 30, 1969, the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange was
acquired by and merged into the Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington
      66

 Stock Exchange," The Honolulu Stock Exchange and the Richmond
 Stock Exchange were exempt from registration during the fiscal year.
Review of Exchange Rules and Procedures
   A major aspect of the Commission's supervisory function with re-
 spect to national securities exchanges is the continuous review by its
 Division of Trading and Markets of the existing rules, regulations,
procedures, forms, and practices of all exchanges. Such review is nec-
essary in order to: (1) ascertain the effectiveness of the application
and enforcement by the exchanges of their rules; (2) determine the
adequacy of exchange rules and of related statutory provisions and
rules administered by the Commission in light of changing market
conditions; and (3) anticipate and define problem areas so that
members of the Commission's staff can meet with exchange repre-
sentatives to work out salutary procedures within the framework of
cooperative regulation. In addition, Rule 1'l'a-8 under the Exchange
Act provides that each national securities exchange must file with
the Commission a report of any proposed amendment or repeal of,
or addition to, its rules and practices not less than 3 weeks (or such
shorter period as the Commission may authorize) before taking any
action to effectuate the change. These proposals are submitted for re-
view and comment to the Branch of Regulation and Inspections of
the Division of Trading and Markets.
  During the 1970 fiscal year, 134 changes in exchange rules and
practices were submitted to the Commission pursuant to Rule
17a-8. Among the more significant were:
   1. Amendments to the New York, American, Midwest and Pacific
Coast Stock Exchange Constitutions and Rules to permit limited
public ownership of member organizations. To minimize inherent
conflict of interest problems involved in public ownership, the
amendments, with certain exceptions, prohibited member organiza-
tions from trading in their own securities,"
   2. The adoption of a new rule by the Midwest Stock Exchange
which gives the Exchange's president, or by delegated authority a
senior vice president, the power to impose such conditions and re-
strictions on member organizations as may be suitable and reasona-
ble to avoid violations of the Exchange's net capital and aggregate
indebtedness ratio requirements or to avoid development of an un-
healthy financial condition by a member organization.

   3. Changes in the policies of the American Stock Exchange which
clarify the reporting and disclosure responsibilities of listed compa-
nies and set forth expanded and more detailed disclosure guidelines.
   4. An amendment of the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange Rules rais-
ing the minimum capital requirement for specialists from $100,000
in cash or liquid assets for each post at which a specialist is regis-
tered to the greater of $100,000in cash or marketable securities or 25
percent of the sum of the market value of its securities positions both
long and short.
   5. Amendments to the New York Stock Exchange and American
Stock Exchange Constitutions requiring that all certificates for
listed securities issued on or after January 1, 1971, carry the appro-
priate CUSIP Identification number. CUSIP is a numbering system
for securities which specifically, uniformly and permanently identi-
fies both the issuer of a security and the particular issue by an
eight-character code number.
Inspections of Exchanges
   Pursuant to the regulatory scheme of the Exchange Act, the Com-
mission actively oversees the discharge by the national securities ex-
 changes of their self-regulatory responsibilities. As part of the pro-
gram, the Branch of Regulation and Inspections in the Division of
Trading and Markets conducts regular inspections of various phases
of exchange activity. These inspections are a means of ensuring ex-
change performance of regulatory responsibilities and enable the
Commission to recommend, where appropriate, improvements and
refinements designed to increase the effectiveness of self-regulation.
   In cases where it appears that revisions in internal policies are de-
sirable in order to improve an exchange's performance, the Commis-
sion's staff communicates its views to the particular exchange and
discusses the matters with exchange personnel to arrive at appropriate
solutions.
   In fiscal 1970, the Branch of Regulation and Inspections con-
ducted eighteen formal inspections. General inspections of the Mid-
west, National and Pacific Coast Stock Exchanges were conducted,
while inspections of the New York, American and Philadelphia-Bal-
timore-Washington Stock Exchanges were limited to exchange activ-
ities in specific areas.
   In May 1970, following wide price fluctuations in certain securi-
ties, the Commission examined the activities of the specialists on the
New York and American Stock Exchanges. The inspections
concentrated upon but were not limited to the performance of the
specialists during the period of these fluctuations. Each specialist's
daily net sale or purchase balances in particular stocks were com-
                      THIRTY-SIXTH      ANNUAL REPORT                         69
 pared with the daily price change for that stock. This is termed the
 "net balance destabilizing test" and is one of the means utilized to
 determine the effectiveness of the specialist in helping to maintain
  an orderly, fair and stable market. The Commission's staff also stud-
 ied other aspects of the specialists' performance and gathered infor-
 mation concerning the capital and financing arrangements of spe-
 cialists. Recommendations based on these inspections are being
 prepared by the staff.
    Recent market activity which affected the financial condition of
 many broker-dealers prompted the staff to inspect the administration
 and interpretation by the New York Stock Exchange of its net capi-
 tal rule." The net capital rules of the Commission and the various
 exchanges are designed to provide safeguards for public investors by
 setting standards of financial responsibility for brokers and dealers.
 Members in good standing and subject to the capital rules of the
 New York Stock Exchange and other major exchanges are exempt
 from the Commission's rule. The basic concept of the net capital
 rules is adequate liquidity; they are intended to require that the bro-
ker or dealer maintain sufficient liquid assets to cover his current in-
 debtedness at all times. An adequate net capital rule, properly en-
 forced, is, therefore, an important aspect of the regulation of brokers
and dealers in the public interest and for the protection of investors.
The results of this special inspection are being evaluated.
   As a result of an examination by the Commission staff of the pro-
cedures of the Philadelphia-Baltimore-'Vashington Stock Exchange
for evaluating the financial condition of its members, particularly
odd-lot dealer-specialists, significant rule and policy changes were
implemented by the Exchange. These changes included more strin-
gent reporting requirements for members so as to provide more fre-
quent and complete records of the financial condition of odd-lot
dealer-specialists. In addition, procedural changes to eliminate cer-
tain floor activities that resulted in the reporting of double volume
figures in certain securities transactions were instituted.
Delisting of Securities From Exchanges
   Under Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act and the
Commission's Rule 12d2-2 thereunder, securities may be stricken
from listing and registration upon application by an exchange, or
withdrawn from listing and registration upon application by an is-
suer, in accordance with the rules of the exchange and upon such
terms as the Commission may impose for the protection of investors.

these problems.
70                  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

   During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1970, the Commission
granted applications for the removal of 57 stock issues, representing
53 issuers, and 2 bond issues from listing and registration. Since 3
stocks were each delisted by two exchanges and 1 stock was delisted
by three exchanges, the total of stock removals was 62. The distribu-
tion of these removals among exchanges was as follows:
                                                                       Sloch   Bond.

    Delisting applications by exchanges are generally based on the
 ground that continued listing is no longer appropriate because of a
 reduced number of shares of the issue in public hands or an insuffi-
 cient number of shareholders (sometimes resulting from acquisitions
 or mergers) ; the low market value of outstanding shares; insufficient
 trading volume on the exchange; failure to meet the exchange's re-
 quirements as to earnings or financial condition; failure to file re-
 quired reports with the exchange; cessation of operations by the
 issuer; or a combination of these factors.
    During the fiscal year, the Commission in two instances granted
delisting applications by the American Stock Exchange which were
opposed by issuers. In Intercontinental Industries, Inc. ("INI"),4
the Exchange had found that INI disseminated or permitted the
dissemination of inaccurate or misleading information concerning cor-
porate developments. Its application was based primarily on an Ex-
change delisting guideline that securities of a company which fails
to comply with its listing agreement with the Exchange (requiring
among other things prompt disclosure of material developments) are
subject to suspension and, "unless prompt corrective action is taken,
removal from listing."
   INI contended, among other things, that the delisting guideline
relied on by the Exchange permits removal only if following a sus-
pension of trading prompt corrective action is not taken, and
pointed to instances of suspensions based on misrepresentations
where the Exchange permitted resumption of trading after correc-
tive action had been taken. It further contended that the Exchange's
rules should be construed to permit delisting only where there had

                     THIRTY-SIXTH      ANNUAL REPORT                        71
been a continuous pattern of misrepresentations amounting to will-
ful fraud, and it stressed that unlike the situation in other delisting
cases it met the Exchange's criteria for listing.
   The Commission rejected these arguments and granted the Ex-
change's application. Stressing the importance of prompt and accu-
rate disclosure of material corporate developments, it held among
other things that it could not find unreasonable the Exchange's in-
terpretation of its rules as requiring that an issuer take corrective
action promptly, and not merely, as contended by INI, promptly
after the Exchange has had to resort to a suspension of trading. The
Commission noted that over 2 months had elapsed from the time
INI disseminated misleading information until it had published a
clarification, despite a marked increase in the price of, and volume
of trading in, INI stock, and inquiries by the Exchange as to the
cause of such increase,"
   In the other case, Lee Motor Products, Ine.,6 the Exchange's ac-
tion was based on Lee's failure to meet assets and earnings tests
specified in the Exchange's delisting guidelines. The Commission, in
granting the application, held among other things that the Ex-
change's failure to find or assert noncompliance with general factors
recited in the introductory section of its delisting guide did not re-
quire denial of the application; that the Exchange properly acted on
the basis of established facts rather than on the basis of a Pl'O forma
situation assuming consummation of certain proposed acquisitions by
Lee; and that it was not improper for the Exchange to consider
losses incurred prior to the date of guideline revisions.
Automated Trading Information     Systems
   During the 1970 fiscal year three automated trading information
systems developed primarily to facilitate trading in large blocks of
securities commenced operations. These systems are Instinet, .Autex
and the Block .Automation System (B.AS) of the New York Stock
Exchange.' Instinet's system is designed so that it can operate with-
out the services of separate brokers acting as intermediaries for
large purchasers and sellers of securities, particularly institutions,
and permits the conduct of negotiations via its computer . .Autex and
B.AS, on the other hand, also provide information as to the available
markets for the securities in the system but rely on the services of
intermediary brokers to handle negotiations and executions outside
of the system. The B.AS system has been limited to displaying inter-

est messages in New York Stock Exchange listed stocks, but the Ex-
change has announced plans to include American Stock Exchange
securities in the near future.
   During the fiscal year the staff visited the main officesof Instinet,
Autex and BAS. These visits were designed to further acquaint the
Commission with the individual systems and to enable the Commis-
sion to better evaluate possible regulatory approaches to them. As
noted in the 35th Annual Report," proposed Rule 15c2-10 under the
Exchange Act, which would provide a regulatory framework for au-
tomated trading information systems that are not within the exist-
ing scope of regulation of exchanges and national securities associa-
tions,? was published for comment last year. The comments on this
proposal that were received are under review.
  STATISTICS RELATING TO SECURITIES TRADED ON EXCHANGES
Number of Issuers and Securities
   As of June 30, 1970, 5382 stock and bond issues, representing 3073
issuers, were admitted to trading on securities exchanges in the
United States. Of these, 5245 securities issues (3459 stock issues and
1786 bond issues), representing 2980 issuers, were listed and regis-
tered on national securities exchanges, the balance consisting primar-
ily of securities admitted to unlisted trading privileges and securi-
ties listed on exempted exchanges, The listed and registered issues
included 1811 stock issues and 1515 bond issues, representing 1592 is-
suers, listed and registered on the New York Stock Exchange. Thus,
with reference to listed and registered securities, 51.8 percent of the
issuers, 52.4 percent of the stock issues and 84.8 percent of the bond
issues were on the New York Stock Exchange. Table 4 in the appen-
dix to this report contains comprehensive statistics as to the number
of securities issues admitted to exchange trading and the number of
issuers involved.
   During the 1970 fiscal year, 346 issuers listed and registered secur-
ities on a national securities exchange for the first time, while the
registration of all securities of 130 issuers was terminated. A total of
710 applications for registration of securities on exchanges was filed.
Market Value of Securities Available for Trading
   As of December 31, 1969, the market value of stocks and bonds
admitted to trading on U.S. stock exchanges was approximately
$786 billion. The tables below show various components of this
figure.

    With reference to the ta:bles, it should be noted that issues are not
 traded on both the New York and American Stock Exchanges and
 that the figures below Tor "other exchanges" do not include issues
 also traded on the New York or American Stock Exchanges. Ac-
 cordingly, the total figure reflects the number of separate issues ad-
 mitted to trading on national securities exchanges. The figures ex-
 clude issues suspended from trading and a few inactively traded
 issues for which quotations were not available.

   The 3,376 common and preferred stock issues represented over 18.2

   The New York Stock Exchange has reported aggregate market
value of all stocks listed thereon monthly since December 31, 1924,
when the figure was $27.1 billion. The American Stock Exchange
has reported totals as of December 31 annually since 1936. Aggre-
gates for stocks exclusively on the remaining exchanges have been
compiled as of December 31 annually since 1948. The available data
since 1936 appear in Table 5 in the Appendix of this Annual Re-
port. It should be noted that changes in aggregate market value over
the years reflect not only changes in prices of stocks but also such
factors as new listings, mergers into listed companies, removals from
listing and issuance of additional shares of a listed security.

Volume of Seenritiea Traded
   The total volume of securities traded on all exchanges in calendar
year 1969 was 5.1 billion shares, including stocks, rights and war-
rants, and $5.1 billion principal amount of bonds. The 1969 total
dollar value of all issues traded was $181 billion. Trading in stocks
declined 7 percent in share volume and 11 percent in dollar value
over 1968. Furthermore, during the first 6 months of 1970, stock
trading volume declined somewhat from the 1969 pace.

trading in foreign stocks in relation to aggregate volume also in-
creased, from 2.4 percent in 1968 to 3.4 percent in 1969.
Comparative Exchange Statiatica
  During the fiscal year 1970, there was a moderate increase in the
total number of stocks listed on exchanges. The increase in listings
on the New York and American Stock Exchanges was consistent
with the trend of recent years; the number of stocks listed exclu-
sively on other exchanges increased for the second straight year,
continuing the reversal of the downward trend that had prevailed
for many years.

exchanges halted their steady climb of the preceding 6 years and
declined 5 and 11 percent, respectively. In the first 6 months of 1970,
the rates of decline over the comparable period in 1969 were 10 per-
cent for share volume and 27 percent for dollar value, with most of
these reductions attributable to the marked decline in trading on the
American Stock Exchange.

  In 1969, the ratio of share volume on the New York Stock Ex-
change to the total on all exchanges reversed the declining trend of
the past five years, but its value ratio declined slightly. On the
American Stock Exchange, where the percentage of share and dollar
volume had risen steadily since 1963, slight declines were registered.
The regional exchange percentage of both share and dollar volume
increased moderately in 1969. In the first 6 months of 1970, both the
share volume and dollar volume ratios for the New York Stock Ex-
change increased markedly, while these ratios for the American
Stock Exchange declined significantly. Both ratios for regional ex-
changes showed moderate gains. Stocks, rights and warrants are in-
cluded in the following presentation. Annual data in more detail are
shown in Appendix Table 7 of this report.

 Block Distributions Reported by Exchanges
   The usual method of distributing blocks of listed securities consid-
ered too large for the auction market on the floor of an exchange is
to resort to "secondary distributions" over the counter after the close
of exchange trading. There were 142 secondary distributions in 1969
compared to 174 in the preceding year. The dollar value of the
shares sold in this manner declined 21 percent to $1,244.2 billion.
 During the first 6 months of 1970, there were 31 secondary distribu-
tions with a total value of $205.8 million.
   Special Offering Plans were adopted by many of the exchanges in
1942, and Exchange Distribution Plans in 1953, in an effort to keep
as much trading as possible on their floors. There were no special of-
ferings last year. Exchange distributions continued to decline from
the record of 72 in 1963 to 32 in 1969. The value of the 1969 ex-
change distributions fell 44 percent to $52.2million.

Unlisted Trading Privileges on Exchanges
  The number of stocks with unlisted trading privileges which are
not listed and registered on other exchanges further declined during
78                 SECURITIES    AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the fiscal year from 89 to 62. The decline was accounted for by the
 removal of 25 such stocks by the American Stock Exchange, and of
 two by the Honolulu Stock Exchange. During the calendar year
1969, the reported volume of trading on the exchanges in stock with
only unlisted trading privileges decreased to about 47,958,150shares,
or about 0.97 percent of the total volume on all exchanges, from
about 52,321,064 shares, or about 0.98 percent of share volume, dur-
ing calendar year 1968. About 98 percent of the 1969 volume was on
the American Stock Exchange, while two other exchanges contrib-
uted the remaining 2 percent. The share volume in these stocks on
the American Stock Exchange represented 3.5 percent of the total
share volume on that exchange.
   Unlisted trading privileges on exchanges in stocks listed and reg-
istered on other exchanges numbered 2,091 as of June 30, 1970. The
volume of trading in these stocks for the calendar year 1969 was re-
ported at about 168,901,733shares. About 95.7 percent of this volume
was on regional exchanges in stocks listed on the New York or
American Stock Exchanges. The remaining 4.3 percent represented
unlisted trading on the American Stock Exchange in issues which
were listed on regional exchanges but as to which the primary mar-
ket was the American Stock Exchange. While the 168,901,733share
volume amounted to only 3.5 percent of the total share volume on all
exchanges, it represented a substantial portion of the share volume
of most regional exchanges, as reflected in the following approxi-
mate percentages: Cincinnati 56.9 percent, Boston 77.9 percent, Pa-
cific Coast 29.6 percent, Midwest 34.5 percent, and Pittsburgh 60.1
percent.t?
   Applications by exchanges for unlisted trading privileges in
stocks listed on other exchanges, filed pursuant to Rule 12f-1 under

    SUPERVISION OF ACTIVITIES OF NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF
                  SECURITIES DEALERS, INC.
    Section 15A of the Exchange Act provides for registration with
 the Commission of national securities associations and establishes
 standards and requirements for such associations. The National As-
 sociation of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD) is the only association
 registered under the Act. The Act contemplates that such associa-
 tions will serve as a medium for self-regulation by over-the-counter
 brokers and dealers. Their rules must be designed to protect inves-
 tors and the public interest, to promote just and equitable principles
 of trade, and to meet other statutory requirements. They are to oper-
 ate under the general supervision of the Commission, which is au-
 thorized to review disciplinary actions taken by them," to
 disapprove changes in their rules, and to alter or supplement their
 rules relating to specified matters. Review of NASD rules is carried
 out for similar purposes as the review of exchange rules described at
 page 67.
    In adopting legislation permitting the formation and registration
 of national securities associations, Congress provided an incentive to
 membership by permitting such associations to adopt rules which
preclude a member from dealing with a nonmember broker or dealer
except on the same terms and conditions as the member affords the
general public. The NASD has adopted such rules. As a result,
membership is necessary to profitable participation in underwritings
since members may properly grant price concessions, discounts and
similar allowances only to other members.
   At the close of the fiscal year the NASD had 4,482 members, re-
flecting a net increase of 380 members during the year. This increase
was the net result of 712 admissions to and 332 terminations of
membership. At the end of the year NASD member firms had 7,375
branch offices,reflecting a net increase of 276 officesduring the year.
This increase was the net result of the opening of 2,025 new offices
and the closing of 1,749 offices.During the year the number of regis-
tered representatives and principals, which categories include all
partners, officers,traders, salesmen and other persons employed by or
affiliated with member firms in capacities which require registration,
increased by 34,341 to stand at 193,370 as of June 30, 1970. This in-
crease was the net result of 51,694 initial registrations, 31,331 re-reg-
istrations and 48,684terminations of registrations during the year.
   During this period the NASD administered 105,574 qualification
examinations, of which approximately 73,095 were for NASD quali-

fication and the balance for other agencies, including major ex-
changes, the Commission and various States.
Commission Review of NASD RnIes and Policies
  Under Section 15A(j) of the Exchange Act, the NASD must file
for Commission review, 30 days in advance of their effectiveness,
copies of any proposed rules or rule amendments; these may be dis-
approved by the Commission if not consistent with the requirements
of the Act. In practice, the Commission also normally reviews in ad-
vance of publication general policy statements, directives, and inter-
pretations proposed to be issued by the Association's board of
governors pursuant to its powers to administer and interpret NASD
rules.
  During the fiscal year, numerous changes in or additions to
NASD rules, policies and interpretations were submitted to the
Commission pursuant to these procedures. Among the significant
matters covered in such submissions were:
        1. A revised interpretation of the Board of Governors con-
     cerning corporate financing and covering such matters as the
     fairness of underwriting arrangements and compensation; and a
     new statement of policy concerning venture capital and other
     investments by members prior to public offerings.
        2. The establishment of and amendments to NASD Emer-
     gency Rules of Fair Practice to assist in alleviating members'
     back officeand operational problems, particularly those regulat-
     ing trading hours and undue delays in the delivery of securi-
     ties; and related amendments to the NASD's Uniform Practice
     Code provisions governing procedures used in "buy-ins", and in
     ex-rights, ex-warrants, and ex-dividend trading. In addition, the
     National Clearing Corporation, developed as a subsidiary of the
     NASD, was created to facilitate nationwide stock clearing oper-
     ations for NASD members in the over-the-counter market. In
     another related area, the NASD amended its standards for
     over-the-counter quotations published in news media so as to re-
     quire issuers whose securities are so quoted to include CUSIP
     numbers (Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Pro-
     cedures) on all stock certificates and bond instruments issued on
     or after January 1, 1971.
        3. Amendment to Schedule "D" of the NASD by-laws to pro-
     vide for: (a) the qualifications for securities to be included in
                          THIRTY-SIXTH   ANNUAL REPORT                          81
     the association's automated quotations system (NASDAQ); 12
     and (b) the establishment of high and low usage charge plans
     for NASDAQ Levels II and III service."
  OVER-THE.COUNTER            TRADING IN COMMON STOCKS            LISTED   ON
               THE          NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE

   In accordance with Rule 17a-9 under the Exchange Act, since
January 1965 brokers and dealers who make markets in common
stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange (sometimes referred
to as the "third market") have been reporting their trading over the
counter and on exchanges in those New York Stock Exchange com-
mon stocks in which they make markets. They also report certain
off-board trading in other common stocks listed on the Exchange.
Brokers-dealers who are not market makers report their large third
market transactions. The reporting system is designed to reflect all
sales to persons other than broker-dealers, i.e., to individuals and in-
stitutions. Prior to 1967, reports were also required for common
stocks listed on other registered securities exchanges. This require-
ment was discontinued, however, since about 98 percent of over-the-
counter volume in listed common stocks is in New York Stock Ex-
change issues.
   During the calendar year 1969, total over-the-counter sales of
common stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange continued to
increase as they have in every year since 1965.Third market sales in
1969 amounted to 155.4 million shares, valued at $7,128 million.
Third market volume also continued to increase at a greater rate
than Exchange volume. As a result, over-the-counter dollar volume
in New York Stock Exchange common stocks amounted to 5.5 per-
cent of the dollar volume in COITUnon     and preferred issues on the
Exchange, a new high ratio.
   In the first half of 1970, volume in the third market declined but
not as sharply as Exchange volume. Consequently, over-the-counter
dollar volume in New York Stock Exchange common stocks rose to
a record high of 7.1 percent of the dollar volume on the Exchange.

   13 Level II service will supply trading   departments of securities firms and
such other persons as the NASD's Board of Governors may authorize with ac-
tual current quotations of over-the-counter market makers for securities in-
cluded in the system. Level III service is similar to that of Level II except that
it will be available only to market makers registered with the NASD and will
include input devices to enable market makers to insert their current quotations
into the system.

  REGULATION            OF BROKER.DEALERS                     AND INVESTMENT                  ADVISERS

Registration
    Subject to limited exemptions, the Securities Exchange Act re-
 quires all brokers and dealers who use the mails or the means of in-
 terstate commerce in the conduct of an over-the-counter securities
business to register with the Commission. Similarly, investment ad-
 visers (with certain exceptions) must register under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, which establishes a pattern of regulation com-
parable to that established by the Exchange Act with respect to bro-
kers and dealers. Applicants for registration which are subject to a
statutory disqualification may be denied registration, and misconduct
following registration may result in suspension or revocation of the
registration. 14
   As of June 30, 1970, 5,224 broker-dealers and 3,060 investment ad-
visers were registered. These figures reflect substantial increases in
both categories during the year.
   The following tabulation reflects various data with respect to reg-
istrations of brokers and dealers and investment advisers during the
1970 fiscal year:

Microfilming of Records
  The Commission has encouraged the use of automation in many
facets of the securities business, including the maintenance of books
and records, so as to promote economies and efficienciesas well as
improved service for the public. Rule 17a-4 under the Exchange
Act, prior to its amendment during the fiscal year, required preser-
vation of records in hard copy form except that it permitted the
substitution of a photograph on film after a period of two years fol-
lowing creation of the record. The Commission amended Rule
17a-415 to permit records to be immediately produced on microfilm
and maintained and preserved in that form, provided that a broker-
dealer using the microfilm record has readily available at all times
appropriate equipment for Commission examination of the records

 84             SECURITIES    A..."N"D

and for the prompt production of such records in "hard copy" form
upon request of the Commission. In addition, as protection against
possible loss of records, the amendment provides that duplicate cop-
ies must be made of all microfilm records on a current basis and
stored separately.
Financial Reports of Broker-Dealers
    Rule 17a-5 under the Exchange Act requires registered broker-
 dealers to file annual reports of financial condition with the Com-
 mission. These reports must be certified by a certified public accoun-
 tant or public accountant who is in fact independent, with certain
 limited exemptions applicable to situations where certification does
 not appear necessary for customer protection. During the fiscal year
 4,459 reports were filed with the Commission.
   These reports enable the Commission and the public to determine
the financial position of broker-dealers. They provide one means by
 which the staff of the Commission can determine whether a broker-
 dealer is in compliance with the net capital rule. Failure to file re-
 quired reports may result in the institution of administrative pro-
ceedings to determine whether the public interest requires remedial
action against the registrant, as well as possible injunctive or crimi-
nal action.
   Form X-17A-5, the form for filing annual broker-dealer finan-
cial reports, was amended during the fiscal year to require that se-
curities listed in "failed to deliver" accounts with respect to
transactions which had been outstanding 30 days or more be classi-
fied according to the length of time that the transactions had been
outstanding." This amendment corresponds to the amendment of the
net capital rule during the previous fiscal year 17 which required that
in computing net capital, deductions be made based on outstanding
items in the "failed to deliver" account.
Broker-Dealer Income and Expense Reports
   In order to obtain improved financial information concerning the
securities industry, the Commission, in June 1968, adopted Rule
17a-10 under the Securities Exchange Act, effective January 1,
1969.18 This rule requires registered broker-dealers and exchange
members to file income and expense reports for each calendar year
with the Commission or with a registered self-regulatory orzaniza-
                                       ~                b            I:>

   (b) of the rule. The self-regulatory organization is to transmit cop-
  ies of such reports to the Commission. All reports are submitted to
  the Commission on a confidential basis.
     Since the end of the 1969 fiscal year, the Commission has ap-
  proved the plans of the NASD, and the American, Midwest, and
  Philadelphia-Baltimore-'Vashington Stock Exchanges under para-
  graph (b) of the rule." In summary, these plans provide that the
  self-regulatory organization will (1) adopt and implement appropri-
  ate internal procedures for review of the reports submitted by mem-
  bers, (2) review all reports filed for reasonableness and accuracy,
  (3) transmit edited reports to the Commission (excluding the names
  and addresses of the respective firms), and (4) undertake certain
  other obligations.
     The reports covering calendar year 1969 of SECO broker-
 dealers 20 and non-NASD members of those exchanges which have
 not qualified a plan have been received and reviewed by the Com-
 mission. The 1969 reports of all NASD members and of non-NASD
 members of those exchanges which have qualified a plan have been
 received by the Commission from the respective self-regulatory or-
 ganizations. It is anticipated that the Commission or the NASD will
 publish aggregate information based on all the data received.
    During the fiscal year, the Commission amended Rule 17a-10 to
 extend the time within which the required reports must be filed. As
 amended, the rule requires reports to be filed within 120 days after
 the close of the calendar year instead of the 90-day period pre-
viously provided. This amendment was adopted because the program
is new and it appeared that a number of firms would have difficulty
in meeting the previous time schedule." The rule was also amended
to provide an orderly procedure for obtaining extensions of time
 (for a maximum of 30 days) for filing the report in cases of undue
hardship.>
    The Commission also amended the income and expense report
form (Form X-17A-10) in certain respects. The changes were
largely technical in nature and did not require the filing of addi-
tional financial information. They were designed primarily to aid in
maintaining the statistical continuity of the data to be compiled

from the reports over a period of time and to clarify questions
which had arisen regarding the reporting requirements."
Disclosure of Credit Terms in Margin Transactions
   The "Truth in Lending Act" specifically exempts brokers' margin
loans to customers from its disclosure requirements. The Commission
had advised Congress that it had adequate authority under the Se-
curities Exchange Act to require disclosure of the cost of credit, and
the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, in its report on the
legislation, stated that it intended that the Commission adopt appro-
priate regulations as soon as possible. In response to this mandate
the Commission, in December 1969, adopted Rule 10b-16 under the
Securities Exchange Act to require meaningful disclosure of the
credit terms to securities customers in margin transactions." The
Rule requires broker-dealers who extend credit to customers to
finance securities transactions to furnish specified information with
respect to the amount of and reasons for the credit charges, includ-
ing an initial disclosure and periodic subsequent disclosures. The ini-
tial disclosure is designed to insure that the investor, before his ac-
count is opened, understands the terms and conditions under which
credit charges will be made. This will enable him to compare the
various credit terms available to him and to understand the methods
used in computing the actual credit charges. The purpose of the pe-
riodic statement is to inform the investor of the actual cost of credit
and, with the aid of the initial disclosure, enable him to accurately
assess that cost.
Factual Basis for Securities Quotations
  The Commission is constantly concerned about practices which re-
sult in substantial amounts of unregistered securities entering the
public market in the absence of any reliable information regarding
the issuer and at prices for which there is no reasonable basis. As
discussed in last year's report," on July 2, 1969, the Commission is-
sued a release drawing particular attention to situations involving
"spin offs" of securities and trading in the securities of shell
corporations."
  The Commission pointed out in that release that the unlawful
practices there described depended for their consummation in many

 instances on the activities of brokers and dealers, who were re-
 minded of their obligation "to make diligent inquiry concerning the
 issuer and [obtain] sufficient information to justify their activity in
 the security." The broker-dealer conduct in question, which has also
 occurred in other settings, has included "the hasty submission of
 quotations in the daily sheets of the National Quotation Service,
 Inc. in the absence of any information about the security or the is-
 suer and before an opportunity is afforded to public investors to
 acquire such information in order to make an informed investment
 judgment. In many cases this practice has resulted in an irresponsi-
 ble 'numbers' game which, apart from having the effect of foisting
 unseasoned securities on the investing public, is not only disruptive
of the market but fraught with manipulative potential." 27
   To furnish appropriate safeguards in these respects, the Commis-
sion announced a proposal to adopt Rule 15c2-11 under the Ex-
change Act.28 The rule would provide that a broker-dealer may not
submit a quotation to an inter-dealer-quotation-system for a security
which has not been the subject of quotations on a regular basis dur-
ing the previous 30 days or which is not currently subject to and
meeting certain statutory disclosure or reporting requirements unless
the broker-dealer has furnished certain specified financial and other
pertinent information to the inter-dealer-quotation-system at the
time of the submission of the quotation and makes that information
available to anyone expressing an interest in the security.
Regulation of Broker-Dealers Who Are Not Members of a Registered Securities
  Association
   Under the Exchange Act, as amended in 1964,the Commission has
the responsibility for establishing and administering rules relating
to qualification standards and business conduct of broker-dealers
who are not members of the National Association of Securities Deal-
ers, Inc. (NASD) 29 and persons associated with them, so as to pro-
vide regulation for these nonmember broker-dealers (also referred to
as "SECO" broker-dealers) comparable to that provided by the
NASD for its mernbers.s?
  During the fiscal year, the number of nonmember broker-dealers
decreased from 455 to 336 and the number of associated persons of
such firms (which includes principally partners, officers, directors,

  29   The .Act does not specifically refer to the N.ASD, but to broker-dealers who

N.ASD is the only such association.

and employees not engaged in merely clerical or ministerial func-
tions) decreased from 19,750 to 19,504.31 The principal reason for the
decrease in the number of nonmember broker-dealers was the de-
registration of 94 general agent broker-dealers engaged in the mar-
keting of variable annuities, who subsequently became associated
persons of a single nonmember broker-dealer.

   Various rules have been adopted by the Commission since 1964 in
the development of its regulatory program for nonmember broker-
dealers." One of the requirements is that each associated person en-
gaged in specified securities activities successfully complete the Com-
mission's General Securities Examination or an examination deemed
by the Commission to be a satisfactory alternative. Alternative
examinations include those given by the NASD, by certain of the
national securities exchanges and by many states. During the fiscal
year the list of states administering acceptable alternative examina-
tions was updated as the result of a survey conducted by the Com-
mission's staff.33 The Commission also discontinued its recognition of
Part I of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
(NAIC) examination as an acceptable alternative for variable annu-
ities salesmen." The NAIC had requested such action.
   Rule 15b9-2 under the Act provides for an annual assessment to
be paid by nonmember broker-dealers to defray the costs of regula-
  31 Nonmember broker-dealers must file a prescribed form (Form SECO-2)

with the Commission for each associated person.

tion. It includes a base fee, a charge £01' each office,and a charge £01'
each associated person. The rule also provides that the maximum
amount payable by anyone SECO member is set each year on the
assessment form which must be filed by each firm. The maximum £01'
fiscal year 1970 was raised from $20,000to $25,000.35
   Pursuant to the inspection program for nonmember broker-deal-
ers, 48 inspections were conducted during the fiscal year. These
inspections were designed to determine compliance with applicable
Commission rules and to obtain information which will pro\'e help-
ful in the further development of the SECO program.
                            STATISTICAL STUDIES
   The regular statistical activities of the Commission and its partic-
ipation in the overall Government statistical program under the
direction of the Office of Statistical Standards, Office of Manage-
ment and Budget, were continued during fiscal 1970 in the Commis-
sion's Office of Policy Research. The statistical series described
below are published in the Commission's monthly Statistical Bulle-
tin. In addition, current figures and analyses of data are published
quarterly on new securities offerings, stock transactions of financial
institutions, the financial position of corporations, and plant and
equipment expenditures.
Issues Registered Under the Securities Act of 1933
   Monthly statistics are compiled on the number and volume of reg-
istered securities. Summary statistics £01' the years Hl35-70 are
given in Appendix Table 1 and detailed statistics £01' the fiscal year
1970 appear in Appendix Table 2.
New Securities Offerings
   Monthly and quarterly data are compiled covering all new corpo-
rate and noncorporate issues offered £01' cash sale in the United
States. The series includes not only issues publicly offered but also
issues privately placed, as well as other issues exempt from registra-
tion under the Securities Act, such as intrastate offerings and offer-
ings of railroad securities. The offerings series include only securi-
ties actually offered £01' cash sale, and only issues offered £01' the
account of issuers.
   Estimates of the net cash flow through securities transactions are
prepared quarterly and are derived by deducting, from the amount
of estimated gross proceeds received by corporations through the
sale of securities, the amount of estimated gross payments by COl'pO-
rations to investors £01' securities retired. Data on gross issues, re-

 35   Securities Exchange Act Release No. 8893 (May 27,1970).
90             SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

tirements and net change in securities outstanding are presented for
all corporations and for the principal industry groups.
Individuals' Saving
   The Commission no longer compiles quarterly estimates of the
Volume and Composition of Individuals' Saving in the United
States. During the fiscal year 1970 these savings statistics were made
consistent with those published by the Federal Reserve Board, and
the Board now produces and publishes saving statistics as part of its
flow-of-funds statistical program, including seasonally adjusted as
well as unadjusted data.
Private Noninsured Pension Funds
  An annual survey is published of private pension funds other
than those administered by insurance companies, showing the flow of
money into these funds, the types of assets in which the funds are
invested and the principal items of income and expenditures. Quar-
terly data on assets of these funds are published in the Statistical
Bulletin.
Stock Transactions of Financial Institutions
   A statistical series containing data on stock trading of four prin-
cipal types of financial institutions is published quarterly. Informa-
tion on purchases and sales of common stock by private noninsured
pension funds and nonlife insurance companies has been collected on
a quarterly basis by the Commission since 1964; these data are com-
bined with similar statistics prepared for mutual funds by the In-
vestment Company Institute and for life insurance companies by the
Institute of Life Insurance.
Financial Position of Corporations
   The series on the working capital position of all U.S. corporations,
excluding banks, insurance companies, investment companies and
savings and loan associations, shows the principal components of
current assets and liabilities, and also contains an abbreviated analy-
sis of the sources and uses of corporate funds.
   The Commission, jointly with the Federal Trade Commision, com-
piles a quarterly financial report of all U.S. manufacturing concerns.
This report gives complete balance sheet data and an abbreviated in-
come account, data being classified by industry and size of company.
Plant and Equipment Expenditures
  The Commission, together with the Department of Commerce,
conducts quarterly and annual surveys of actual and anticipated
plant and equipment expenditures of all U.S. business, exclusive of
agriculture. After the close of each quarter, data are released on ac-
                    THIRTY-SIXTH    ANNUAL REPORT                   91
tual capital expenditures of that quarter and anticipated expendi-
tures for the next two quarters. In addition, a survey is made at the
beginning of each year of the plans for business expansion during
that year.
Directory of Registered Companies
   The Commission annually publishes a list of companies required
to file annual reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In
addition to an alphabetical listing, there is a listing of companies by
industry group classified according to The Standard Industrial Clas-
sification Manual.
Stock Market Data
   The Commission regularly compiles statistics on the market value
and volume of sales on registered and exempted securities exchanges,
round-lot stock transactions on the New York and American Stock
Exchanges for account of members and nonmembers, odd-lot trans-
actions in 100 selected stocks on the New York Stock Exchange and
block distributions of exchange stocks. Since January 1965, the Com-
mission has been compiling statistics on volume of over-the-counter
trading in common stocks listed on national securities exchanges (the
so-called "third market") based on reports filed under Rule 17a-9 of
the Securities Exchange Act.
   Data on round-lot and odd-lot trading on the New York and
American Stock Exchanges are released weekly. The other stock
market data mentioned above, as well as these weekly series, are
published regularly in the Commission's Statistical Bulletin.
                                          PART IV
                  CONTROL OF IMPROPER                     PRACTICES
   One of the major areas of the Commission's work is its enforce-
 ment activities, which encompass the detection and investigation of
 possible violations of the Federal securities laws and the taking of
 appropriate action to curtail fraudulent and other improper activi-
ties. The Commission's enforcement program is designed to achieve a
broad regulatory impact within the framework of its limited man-
power. In addition to direct action by the Commission, the various
self-regulatory organizations have a responsibility (subject to Com-
mission oversight) to ferret out and take appropriate action with re-
spect to improper practices by their respective members. Moreover,
there is a significant degree of coordination between the enforcement
activities of the Commission, the self-regulatory agencies, the var-
ious states, and certain foreign securities agencies.
   This part of the report deals with some of the more significant as-
pects of these enforcement activities conducted during the fiscal
year and with developments in litigation arising out of prior en-
       1


forcement actions. It also summarizes certain noteworthy cases in-
volving private litigation under the securities acts in which the
Commission participated as amicus curiae.
                    DETECTION        OF IMPROPER          PRACTICES
Public Complaints and Inquiries
   The Commission receives many communications from the public,
consisting predominantly of complaints against members of the se-
curities industry and requests for information about issuers. These
complaints and inquiries are given careful attention. In most in-
stances the matters raised can be informally resolved, However,
where violations of the Federal securities laws are indicated, the
matters are referred to the enforcement officials of the Commission
for appropriate action. The Commission may also refer matters to
the stock exchanges or the National Association of Securities Deal-
ers, Inc. (NASD). Analysis of complaints and inquiries helps the
Commission to recognize problems being experienced by a particular
firm or by the industry in general.

1'"'1      During fiscal uno the Commission received some 15,000 written
"'1
        and telephonic complaints and inquiries from the public relating
        specifically to broker-dealers, of which about 85 percent involved
        back-office problems. The remainder were divided between com-
        plaints of improper conduct and inquiries regarding various indus-
        try practices.
           Other sources of information regarding possible securities viola-
        tions include information received from stock exchanges, the NASD,
        brokerage firms, State and Canadian securities authorities, better
        business bureaus, and various law enforcement agencies.
        Inspections
          The program of surprise inspections of broker-dealers and invest-
        ment advisers by the Commission's staff is another important device
        for the detection of improper practices. During fiscal 1970, the staff
        conducted 707 broker-dealer inspections (as compared with 732 the
        previous year) and 96 inspections of investment advisers (as compared
        to 128 during the previous year).
          The table below shows the types of infractions indicated by the
        inspections conducted during the fiscal year:

           * "Hedge clauses" used in literature distributed by investment advisers gen-
        erally state in substance that the information furnished is obtained from sources
        believed to be reliable, but that no assurance can be given as to its accuracy. A
        clause of this nature may be improper where the recipient may be led to believe
        that he has waived any right of action against the investment adviser.
94             SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Market Surveillance
    In order to enable the Commission to meet its responsibilities for
 the surveillance of the securities markets, the market surveillance
 staff has devised a number of procedures to identify possible manip-
 ulative activities. A program has been adopted with respect to sur-
 veillance over listed securities, in which the staff's activities are
 closely coordinated with the stock watching operations of the New
 York and American Stock Exchanges. 'WIthin this framework, the
 staff reviews the daily and periodic stock watch reports prepared by
 these exchanges and, on the basis of its analysis of the information
 developed by the exchanges and other sources, determines matters of
 interest, possible violations of applicable law, and the appropriate
 action to be taken.
    In addition, the market surveillance staff maintains a continuous
 ticker tape watch of transactions on the New York and American
 Stock Exchanges and the sales and quotation sheets of regional ex-
changes to observe any unusual or unexplained price variations or
market activity. The financial news ticker, leading newspapers and
various financial publications and statistical services are also closely
 followed.
    If any of these sources reveals possible violations, the market sur-
veillance staff conducts a preliminary inquiry into the matter. These
inquiries, some of which are conducted with the cooperation of the
exchange concerned, generally begin with the identification of the
brokerage firms which were active in the security. The staff may
communicate with partners, officers or registered representatives of
the firm, with customers, or with officials of the company in question
to determine the reasons for the activity or price change in the se-
curities involved and whether violations may have occurred.
    The Commission has also developed an over-the-counter surveil-
lance program involving the use of automated equipment to provide
more efficient and comprehensive surveillance. That equipment is
programmed to identify, among other things, unlisted securities
whose price movement or dealer interest varies beyond specified lim-
its in a pre-established time period. When a security is so identified,
the automated system prints out current and historic market infor-
mation concerning it. This data, combined with other available in.
formation, is collated and analyzed to select those securities whose
activity indicates the need for further inquiry or referral to the
Commission's enforcement staff.
Use of Computer for Name Searches
  The use of the Commission's computer for "name searches" in the
enforcement program has resulted in a substantial increase in the
                   THIRTY-SIXTH    ANNUAL REPORT                     95
amount of information available and the speed with which it can be
obtained. The names of suspected securities law violators are
checked against the more than 1 million entries presently stored in
the computer. Upon request, the Commission also performs "name
searches" on prospective securities salesmen and others whose names
are submitted by the exchanges, the NASD, and the State securities
commissions. If the subject checked has been named in formal filings
with the Commission, has been a party to a proceeding, or has been
involved in an investigation, such information, together with perti-
nent dates, relationships, and cross references, is available immedi-
ately on a printout. Formerly a time-consmning manual search of
indices and files was required.
                           INVESTIGATIONS
   Each of the Acts administered by the Commission specifically au-
thorizes it to conduct investigations to determine whether violations
of the Federal securities laws have occurred.
   The nine regional officesof the Commission are chiefly responsible
for the conduct of investigations. In addition, the Officeof Enforce-
 ment of the Division of Trading and Markets at the Commission's
headquarters office conducts investigations dealing with matters of
particular interest or urgency, either independently or with the as-
sistance of the regional offices.The Office of Enforcement also exer-
cises general supervision over and coordinates the investigative ac-
tivities of the regional officesand recommends appropriate action to
the Commission. Investigations are also conducted by the Divisions of
Corporation Finance and Corporate Regulation in the areas under
their respective jurisdictions.
   It is the Commission's general policy to conduct its investigations
on a confidential basis. Such a policy is necessary to effective law en-
forcement and to protect persons against whom unfounded or uncon-
firmed charges might be made. The Commission investigates many
complaints where no violation is ultimately found to have occurred.
To conduct such investigations publicly would ordinarily result in
hardship or embarrassment to many interested persons and might
affect the market for the securities involved, resulting in injury to
investors with no countervailing public benefits. Moreover, members
of the public would tend to be reluctant to furnish information con-
cerning violations if they thought their personal affairs would be
made public. Accordingly, the Commission does not generally divulge
the existence or findings of a nonpublic investigation unless they are
made a matter of public record in proceedings brought before the
Commission or in the courts.
96                    SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

  When it appears from a preliminary investigation that a serious
violation of the Federal securities laws has occurred or is occurring,
a full investigation is conducted. Under certain circumstances the
Commission may issue a formal order of investigation which desig-
nates members of its staff as officers to issue subpoenas, take testi-
mony under oath, and require the production of documents. During
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1970, the Commission issued 176 such
formal orders.
  The following table reflects in summarized form the investigative
activities of the Commission during fiscal 1970:

Enforcement of Investigative Subpoenas
  In S.E.O. Y. Wall Street Transcript Oorp.,2 the Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit, reversing the decision of the district court 3
previously reported,' ordered enforcement of an administrative sub-
poena duces tecum issued in the course of an investigation instituted
to determine whether the 'Vall Street Transcript Corporation by
publishing the Wall Street Transcript was an unregistered invest-
ment adviser. The court of appeals applied the general principle that
whether a particular person or entity is or is not included within
the coverage of a regulatory statute is a question properly to be de-
termined by the regulatory agency in the first instance. It held:
     "So long as an agency establishes that an investigation 'will be conducted
     pursuant to a legitimate purpose, that the inquiry may be relevant to the
     purpose, that the information sought is not already within [its] possession,
     and that the administrative   steps required ...   have been followed,' no
     showing of probable cause need be made to the district court unless a stat-
     ute indicates otherwise." 5
   The court specifically rejected a contention that the express exclu-
sion of the publishers of a "bona fide newspaper . . . or financial
publication" from coverage under the Investment Advisers Act is
based upon constitutional considerations. It stated:
    "The phrase 'bona fide' newspapers, in the context of this list [of exclu-
    sions from the definition of Investment Adviser], means those publications

       which do not deviate from customary newspaper activities to such an ex-
       tent that there is a likelihood that the wrongdoing which the Act was de-
       signed to prevent has occurred. The determination of whether or not a
       given publicatton fits within this exclusion must depend upon the nature of
       its practices rather than upon the purely formal 'indicia of a newspaper'
       which it exhibits on its face and in the size and nature of its subscription
       list" (footnotes omitted). 6
    The court noted that moennewspapers are subject to governmentul
 regulation and concluded that "[t]he Investment Advisers Act does
 not on its face abridge freedom of press simply because it may be
 applied to publications which are classified firmly as part of the
 'press' for some purposes but are not 'bona fide newspapers' excluded
 under the Act." 7 In any event, the court found, a distinction must
 be drawn between political or social speech, on the one hand, and
 purely commercial speech, on the other, in determining the scope of
 First Amendment privileges.
    No fault was found in the breadth of the Commission's subpoena,
the court recognizing its similarity to the subpoena that had been
sustained by the Supreme Court in Oklahoma Press Publishinq 00.
v. Walling.s And the court concluded that no showing had been
made that either the Commission's investigation or the production
contemplated by the subpoena would restrict the Transcript's free-
dom of expression. In rejecting the district court's view that the
Commission's subpoena went to the "jugular of the Transcript as a
publishing firm," 9 the court of appeals found that the subpoena
calls "for the production of certain correspondence and advertising
materials which appear to be directly related to an investigation of
the type of practices which might cause a newspaper to fall outside
the Act's exclusion." 10
                    ENFORCEMENT       AND REMEDIAL      ACTION
   ",Vhenthe Commission determines, based upon staff investigation,
that enforcement action appears appropriate, it may authorize the
staff to institute civil court proceedings for injunctive relief, or, in
particularly serious cases, it may refer the matter to the .Iustice De-
partment with a recommendation for criminal prosecution. In the
case of broker-dealers, persons associated with them, and investment
advisers, the Commission may, on the basis of staff allegations, initi-
ate administrative proceedings which can result in a Commission
order imposing remedial sanctions on the respondent or respondents.

The Commission may also refer matters to state and local enforce-
ment agencies or to industry self-regulatory organizations.
Administrative   Proceedings
    Under the Securities Exchange Act, as amended in 1964, the Com-
 mission has available to it a wide range of administrative sanctions
 which it may impose against brokers and dealers and persons associ-
 ated with them. The Commission may deny a broker-dealer's appli-
 cation for registration. With respect to a broker-dealer already reg-
 istered, it may impose sanctions ranging from censure through
 suspension of registration to revocation of registration. It may also
 suspend or terminate a broker-dealer's membership in a stock ex-
 change or registered securities association. Associated persons of bro-
 ker-dealers may be censured, suspended, or barred from association
 with any broker-dealer. Under the Investment Advisers Act, the
 Commission may impose comparable sanctions against investment
advisers but has no authority to take direct disciplinary action
against persons associated with investment advisers.
    Generally speaking, the Commission may impose a sanction only
if, after notice and opportunity for hearing, it finds (1) that the re-
spondent willfully violated any provision of the securities acts or
the rules thereunder; aided and abetted such violations by others;
 (in the case of broker-dealer proceedings) failed reasonably to su-
pervise another person who committed such violations; or is subject
to certain disqualifications, such as a conviction or injunction relat-
ing to specified types of misconduct; and (2) that a particular sanc-
tion is in the public interest.
   "While all respondents in broker-dealer and investment adviser
proceedings are entitled to a hearing, such proceedings are fre-
quently disposed of without hearings where respondents waive a
hearing and consent to the imposition of certain sanctions or submit
offers of settlement which the Commission accepts as an appropriate
disposition of the proceedings. In those instances where hearings are
held, the hearing officer who presides normally makes an initial deci-
sion, including an appropriate order, unless such decision is waived
by the parties. If Commission review is not sought, and if the case is
not called up for review on the Commission's own initiative, the ini-
tial decision becomes the final decision of the Commission, and the
examiner's order becomes effective.
   In those instances where it prepares its own decision upon review
or waiver of an initial decision, the Commission is generally assisted
by the Officeof Opinions and Review. This Officeis directly responsible
to the Commission and is completely independent of the operating
divisions of the Commission, consistent with the principle of separation

 of functions embodied in the Admininistrative Procedure Act, Where
 the parties to a proceeding waive their right to such separation, the
 operating division which participated in the proceeding may assist
 in the drafting of the Commission's decision.
   The Commission's opinions are publicly released and are distrib-
 uted to the press and to persons on the Commission's mailing list. In
 addition, they are printed and published periodically by the Govern-
 ment Printing Office in bound volumes entitled "Securities and
 Exchange Commission Decisions and Reports."

 pending during fiscal 1970 with respect to brokers and dealers and
 investment advisers.

     Certain of the more significant administrative decisions rendered
  during the fiscal year in broker-dealer proceedings are summarized
  below:
    In Jaffee & Oompany,l1 the Commission found violations of its
  Rule 10b-6 under the Exchange Act in connection with a registered
  secondary offering of stock of Solitron Devices, Inc. Rule 10b-6 in
  substance prohibits participants in a distribution of securities from
  bidding for or purchasing such securities until their participation is
  completed.
    :M. L. Lee & Co., Inc. was the "exclusive agent" for the Solitron
  offering which covered 107,700shares held by 3! stockholders, includ-
  ing 'Wilton L.• Jaffee, Jr., principal partner of Jaffee & Company.
  The shares were to be offered by the sellers from time to time "in
 the proximate future" at then prevailing market prices. During the
 course of the offering, Greene & Company, through its trader, Ber-
 nard Horn, purchased over 25,000 shares of registered stock from
 Lee for resale. At the same time, although Greene and Horn were
 aware that the stock purchased from Lee was part of a registered
 offering, Greene, through Horn, continuously inserted bids for Soli-
 tron in the quotation sheets published by the National Quotation
 Bureau, Inc. and purchased Solitron stock that was not a part of the
 offering. Lee was aware that Greene was entering bids for Solitron
 in the sheets. Yet it continued to sell registered Solitron stock to
 Greene. Jaffee made purchases of Solitron stock for his own account
 during the offering and requested Horn to enter bids for the stock in
 the sheets.
    The Commission held that an offering of stock pursuant to a reg-
 istration statement by its verv nature constitutes a distribution
within the meaning of Rule 10b-6, and that the fact that the Soli-
tron shareholders were able to control the timing of their sales "in
no way obviated the need for the protections of the Rule or gave rise
to any exemption from it." It stated that persons like Greene, engag-
ing in market making activities in a security which at the same time
is being offered in a registered distribution. must not participate in
the distribution unless they have terminated their bidding and pur-
chasing in the open market; that the Rule could be circumvented if
Lee were permitted to sell stock to other broker-dealers engaged in
bidding and purchasing activities although itself refraining from
such conduct; and that .Iaffee, having agreed to participate in the
Solitron offering, became a participant in the distribution irrespec-
tive of any sales of his own registered shares, a participation which

review by Jaffee & Co and W. L. Jaffee are pending (C.A. 2, No. 348JU).
 102            SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

  continued for so long as any of his shares remained unsold or until
 they were withdrawn from registration.
     The Commission further held that Greene and Horn had violated
 Section 5 (b) (2) of the Securities Act by failing to deliver Solitron
 prospectuses to certain customers. It imposed a thirty-day suspen-
 sion on Horn, 20-day suspensions on Jaffee and Jaffee & Company,
 and censure on Greene and Lee.
    Commissioner Smith dissented from the Commission's findings of
 violations of Rule 10b-6 by Greene, Horn, and Lee. He disagreed
 with the majority's determination that a registered offering was per
 se a "distribution" within the meaning of the Rule and concluded
 that a sufficient showing had not been made on the record that
 Greene and Horn had engaged in the kind of activity which would
 support a finding they were participants in a distribution for pur-
 poses of the Rule.
    In Riohard N. Oea,'2 the Commission, on the basis of findings of
 violations of antifraud provisions of the securities acts, barred sev-
 eral persons from further association with any broker-dealer and re-
 voked the broker-dealer registration of a firm which was controlled
 by two of the respondents and which employed another respondent.
    The Commission found that during the period January 1963 to
 October 1964 when they were employed as salesmen by another bro-
 ker-dealer, the individual respondents, in the offer and sale of secu-
rities of Home Makers Savings Corporation ("HMS"), made opti-
mistic representations and predictions concerning the financial con-
dition and prospects of the company and a prospective rise in the
market price of its stock despite knowledge that HMS had never op-
erated at a profit, that its brief history was marked by continual
losses and increasing deficits, and that its only product, an antacid
tablet, had been seized by the Federal government in a condemnation
proceeding in which the government alleged that the name of the
product and the company's advertising material were false and mis-
leading and violated the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
   In addition, the Commission found that two of the respondents in-
duced customers to engage in securities transactions which were ex-
cessive in size and frequency in light of the character of the custom-
ers' accounts, and that certain of them "falsely represented,
expressly or impliedly," to customers who had disclosed their finan-
cial needs and investment objectives, that certain highly speculative
securities met those needs and objectives. The Commission observed:
"It was incumbent on the salesmen in these circumstances, as part of
   12 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 8662 (August 6, 1969), petition for
review dismissed (O.A.D.O., November 26, 1969).
                         THIRTY-SIXTH       ANNUAL REPORT                       103
  their basic obligation to deal fairly with the investing public, to
  make only such recommendations as they had reasonable grounds to
  believe met the customers' expressed needs and objectives."
     In D. H. Blair and 00.,13 which involved extensive transactions
  through an account maintained at Blair in the stock of an obscure
  oil company with negligible operations, the Commission found that
 the account was used by a controlling person of the company to dis-
 tribute unregistered stock and to manipulate the market in such
 stock. It held that the salesman who handled the account violated
 the registration, anti-fraud, and anti-manipulative provisions of the
 securities acts, and it barred him from association with any broker
 or dealer. Various other broker-dealer firms and individuals were
 also sanctioned for participation in the violations or inadequate su-
 pervision, certain of them pursuant to offers of settlement accepted
 by the Commission.
    With respect to one of the respondent firms, which cleared Blair's
 accounts and which was found to have failed reasonably to supervise
 its margin and bookkeeping departments with a view to preventing
 violations of the Securities Act registration requirements, the Com-
 mission stated, in response to the firm's argument that clearing firms
 should not be required to exercise a general responsibility over the
 operations of their "correspondent" firms:
        "We do not undertake in this opinion to impose such a general obligation
       on a clearing firm. Arrangements between clearing and correspondent firms
       are a matter of contract between them, so long as the public customers' in-
       terests are not jeopardized. But where, as here, the record shows that per-
       sonnel of the clearing firm were aware of serious irregularities in an ac-
       count, it seems to us both reasonable and in the public interest to impose
       on that firm an independent obligation to make appropriate inquiry and
       take prompt steps to terminate any participation in activity violative of the
       securities laws."
   In Abbett, Sommer &: 00., Inc.,14 the Commission found, among
other things, that a broker-dealer, its controlling person and a cor-
poration also controlled by him violated the registration provisions
of the securities acts in connection with the offer and sale of certain
mortgage notes. The respondents purchased these notes from, or sold
them as agent for, a company engaged in the business of buying such
notes at a discount from building contractors and others and resell-
ing them "with recourse" against it in the event of default by the
note maker. The Commission rejected the respondents' claim that the
offer and sale of the notes were exempt from the registration require-

ments of the Securities Act by virtue of Rule 234 which exempts
notes secured by a first lien on real estate if offered in accordance
with specified terms and conditions. It found that an "investment
contract" was in \'01 ved in the offering of the notes and that, under
the terms of the Rule, the exemption was therefore unavailable.
   The Commission pointed out that prior judicial and Commission
decisions had concluded that various contracts which in form in-
volve nothing more than the sale of interests in real estate or chat-
tels were in fact investment contracts and therefore securities be-
cause accompanied by an offer of or representation concerning
services upon which the investor relied to obtain a profit on his pur-
chase. In this case, the notes were sold pursuant to arrangements
under which the note-discounter and the broker-dealer provided var-
ious services, including an investigation of the property and the
mortgagor, the collection of monthly payments for investors, and an
undertaking to some purchasers to repurchase the notes. The Com-
mission stated that it did not
   "consider it significant that in the "investment contract" cases previously
   cited the services were designed to create a profit whereas in the present
   case the services were directed essentially toward minimizing the risks in-
   volved in the investment. In both types of situations, the investor relies
   upon the services and undertakings of others to secure the return of a
   profi t to him."
   The Commission also found that the respondents made misrepre-
sentations in the sale of the mortgage notes and that the broker-
dealer failed to maintain certain records as required. It revoked the
broker-dealer's registration, found the other corporation a "cause" of
the revocation, and barred the controlling person from association
with a broker or dealer.
   In Alfred B. Tallman, JJ'.'5 the Commission addressed itself,
among other things, to the obligation of broker-dealers to maintain
effective mechanisms to insure compliance with applicable require-
ments. One of the respondents in the proceeding had been employed
as a broker-dealer's compliance director. However, he was only 23
when he became so employed, and, although he was clothed with ap-
parently broad compliance responsibilities, he in fact had yery lim-
ited authority and was given inadequate assistance, and he did not
effectively carry out the supervisory duties assigned to him.
   The Commission stated:
    "Broker-dealers have a responsibility to take effective measures to insure
    compliance with the statutory standards and requirements. That responsi-
    bility is not discharged by the setting up of a compliance program with the
    creation of a position designated Compliance Director which does not con-

     fer the authority and provide the personnel, procedures and means neces-
     sary to accomplish its objectives. In such case there is created merely an
     appearance of an effective compliance mechanism. Persons who are as-
     signed to positions of Compliance Directors should be accorded the powers
     to initiate and implement steps required to achieve compliance."
   Although this respondent consented, in an offer of settlement, to
being censured, the Commission determined that under all the cir-
cumstances, including his young age and inexperience and the fact
that this was the first case involving charges against a compliance
employee as such, the public interest did not require that he be cen-
sured, and it discontinued the proceedings as to him.
   In Investors Management 00., Inc., a proceeding involving the ob-
ligations of persons who receive non-public material information
from insiders, an initial decision was rendered during the fiscal year
by a Commission hearing examiner censuring a number of such
"tippees," The information in question, which related to a significant
deterioration in the earnings of Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc., had been
obtained by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., in its
capacity as managing underwriter of a proposed debenture offering by
Douglas in 1966 and had boon conveyed to certain large customers of
Merrill Lynch who effected sales and short sales of Douglas stock prior
to public disclosure of the earnings information and without making
disclosure to purchasers.v
  In his initial decision, the examiner censured 12 "tippee" respond-
ents who he found had willfully violated antifraud provisions of the
securities acts in effecting such sales." The examiners held that persons
other than traditional insiders who obtain material corporate non-
public information and know or should know of its non-public nature
must either disclose such information or abstain from trading in the
securities of the corporation until it is public. He further held that
these obligations exist notwithstanding the absence of any continuing
or close relationship between the corporation or insider and the per-
son using the information.
  Neither the Commission's staff nor any of the respondents sought
Commission review of the initial decision, and the Commission con-

   11 He ordered dismissal of the proceedings as to one respondent      who he
found made no use of the infurmation obtained from :\Ierrill Lynch and discon-
tinuance as to two respondents who he found merely occupied control relation-
ships to some of the violators and did not merit a sanction.
106            SECURITIES   AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

 sidered that there was not sufficient reason to order review of that
 decision with respect to the examiner's factual findings and infer-
 ences, or with respect to the adequacy of the sanctions imposed or
 his determination to dismiss or discontinue the proceedings as to cer-
 tain respondents. The Commission determined, however, to review
 on its own initiative the legal issues involved. !t pointed out that
 such determination did not necessarily imply disagreement with the
 examiner's opinion, but was based on the fact that the issues respect-
 ing the obligations of "tippees" were important matters having sig-
 nificant implications as to which it was desirable that the Commis-
sion express its own views.
    Judicial Review of Administrative Decisions.-In           Armstrong,
Jones & 00. V. S.E.0.,18 the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit
affirmed an order of the Commission 19 which, as previously re-
ported," imposed sanctions upon Armstrong, Jones & Co., a broker-
dealer, and Thomas W'. Itin, its chief executive officer. The court
held that substantial evidence supported the Commission's findings
that the petitioners violated the registration provisions of the Secu-
rities Act when they effected sales of a Michigan insurance com-
pany's unregistered stock to non-Michigan residents shortly after the
firm commenced trading in the stock. Although an intrastate exemp-
tion from registration was claimed, the Commission found that Itin
had actively sought orders for the stock, to be executed immediately
after trading in the stock began, from non-residents of Michigan
and also that sales were made during this period to persons whom
Itin knew or should have known were nominees for non-residents. In
sustaining the Commission's finding that the firm willfully violated
antifraud provisions of the Securities Act, the court approved "the
position of the Commission that a broker-dealer may be sanctioned
for the willful violations of its agents under the doctrine of respon-
deat superior." The applicability of that doctrine was held unaf-
fected by "[t]he fact that Congress enacted an additional provision
giving the Commission the power to impose a sanction on a broker-
dealer for failure to adequately supervise its employees' acts ... " 21 The
court also rejected a contention that facts set forth in various public
records could serve in lieu of the written notice of the fact of com-
mon control between the issuer of a security and the broker-dealer
offering it for sale, which notice is required to be given to a cus-

 tomer pursuant to Rule 15cl-5 under the Securities Exchange Act.22
 The court affirmed the Commission's holding that it was both fraud
 and a violation of record-keeping provisions for the firm to have
 confirmed sales of a new issue of securities to customers who had not
 in fact agreed to the purchases; the court did not reach the question
 whether an indication of interest, which had been given by all of
 these customers, could ever, without more, be considered a binding
 commitment to purchase securities."
   In three separate opinions, the Court of Appeals for the Second
 Circuit affirmed various aspects of the Commission's decision in
 Richard Bruce and 00., Inc.24 In Hillel' v. 8.E.0.,25 and Gross v.
 8.E.0.,26 the court affirmed the imposition of sanctions upon two of
the three principals of Bruce & Co., a broker-dealer firm. The court
 found, in the Hiller case, that Bruce & Co. had acted in disregard of
the "basic obligation of fair dealing [which is] borne by those who
engage in the sale of securities to the public" when it actively solic-
ited purchases of certain speculative securities "without reasonable
grounds for believing that reports disseminated in connection with
such solicitation had a basis in fact." 27 The court held that there
was substantial evidence in the record that Hiller, the firm's presi-
dent, had authorized and even encouraged active solicitation of or-
ders for stock on the basis of unconfirmed reports and rumors and,
for that reason, had properly been held responsible for the firm's
fraudulent course of conduct.
   In affirming the Commission's determination that Gross, who had
been vice-president and secretary of Bruce & Co., had aided and
abetted violations of the antifraud provisions, the Court noted that
Gross had been "aware of the inadequacy of the information avail-
able" concerning the company whose securities were being offered by
the firm and had "also [been] aware of the active solicitation of .•.
stock purchases by representatives of his firm notwithstanding the
deficiency of information." 28 In Fink v. S.E.O., 29 the court upheld im-
position of sanctions upon one of the salesmen of Bruce & Co., reaf-
firming its holding in Hanly v. 8.E.0.30 that the Commission had
the power to increase the sanction imposed by a hearing examiner.

 108             SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

    In another review of a broker-dealer proceeding, the Court of Ap-
 peals for the Sixth Circuit, in Klopp v, S.E.C.,31 reversed the Commis-
 sion's finding, previously reported," that a registered representative
 had violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and the
 Securities Exchange Act. Specifically, the Commission found that
 Ralph 1\1. Klopp, a salesman for Paine, Webber, Jackson & Curtis, in-
 duced excessive trading in the accounts of two customers by means of
 false representations concerning the securities activities of another
 customer. The court of appeals held that the Commission's decision
 was not supported by substantial evidence because the customer wit-
 nesses' testimony was not credible,
   As previously reported." in Beck v, S.E.C.,34 the Court of Ap-
 peals for the Sixth Circuit upheld findings by the Commission of
willful violations by Beck, a securities salesman, of the antifraud
provisions of the securities acts, but it remanded the case to the
Commission for further explanation of the reasons for the sanction
imposed on Beck (a 4-month exclusion from the securities business
with a requirement that subsequent employment be in a nonsupervi-
sory capacity). The Commission thereafter issued an opinion con-
taining such explanation;" After the close of the fiscal year, upon a
renewed petition for review, the Court of Appeals set the sanction
aside." It held that the Commission abused its discretion when it or-
dered remedial sanctions based on the deterrent effect on Beck and
on others in the securities industry. The court found "no reason to
believe that ... [Beck] is inclined to commit any further illegal or
fraudulent acts," 37 and expressed doubt concerning the authority of
the Commission to impose sanctions on violators in order to deter
others. It concluded that under the circumstances, the Commission's
order was punitive, not remedial, and, as such, was not authorized.

  Each of the several statutes administered by the Commission au-

 tial number of these actions were designed to restrain further viola-
 tions of the registration or antifraud provisions of the Securities
 Act and the Securities Exchange Act; many others sought injunc-
 tions against operation of broker-dealers in violation of net capital
 or other investor protection requirements.
    The nature of some of the more noteworthy of these actions, and
 certain appellate decisions in injunctive proceedings, are summarized
 in the following pages.
    In S.E.O. v. Parrin. Dohrmann 001npany,39 the Commission filed a
  complaint in October 1969 against 18 defendants seeking to enjoin
 further violations of the antifraud, reporting, proxy solicitation, and
 extension-of-credit provisions of the Securities Exchange Act in
 connection with the purchase and sale of securities of Parvin Dohr-
 mann Company. It was alleged that one of the defendants, Delbert
 1V. Coleman, had organized a group of investors for the purpose of
 acquiring sufficient stock to obtain control of Parvin Dohrmann and
 had filed untimely statements concerning the group with the Commis-
 sion and the American Stock Exchange, pursuant to Section 13(d) of
 the Securities Exchange Act, which were false and misleading.
    The complaint further alleged that after acquiring control of Par-
 vin Dohrmann, Coleman and other defendants manipulated the mar-
 ket price of Pan-in Dohrmann stock by, among other things: (i)
 purchasing substantial amounts of the stock for the purpose of cre-
 ating actual and apparent market activity and thereby inducing
 purchases by others; (ii) restricting the floating supply of the stock
and thereby causing a rise in its market price; (iii) touting the
stock to certain large institutional and other investors, making avail-
able to them certain material. nonpublic information concerning the
company; and (iv) arranging for purchases off the exchange market
when it was learned that holders of large blocks of stock were about
to sell their interests in open market transactions.
   The complaint also alleged that pursuant to an exchange agree-
ment negotiated by Parvin Dohrmann with defendant Denny's Res-
taurants, Inc., in carly June 1969, each Parvin Dohrmann share-
holder was to have received four shares of Denny's Restaurants
stock in return for each Parvin Dohrmann share held. According to
the complaint, the arrangement was thereafter renegotiated, how-
ever, to provide that certain defendants, all of whom were members
of the Coleman "control" group, would receive cash and notes in the
amount of $150 for each share of their Parvin Dohrmann stock,
while the remaining shareholders would receive only :n~;shares of

  39   S.D.N.Y., 69 Civ. 4543 (ELP).
110               SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

 Denny's Restaurants (having a market value of $100 on July 10,
  1969, the date of the public announcement of the renegotiated ar-
 rangement) for each of their Parvin Dohrmann shares. It was
 charged that these acts unfairly and fraudulently preferred the in-
 terests of certain defendants over those of the public shareholders of
 Parvin Dohrmann.
    It was also alleged that Coleman, Sidney R. Korshak, Nathan V 0-
 loshen and other defendants acted to conceal these unlawful activi-
 ties by filing false, misleading, and inaccurate reports with the
 Commission and the American Stock Exchange, by issuing and dis-
 seminating various false and misleading press releases, and other-
 wise by attempting to suppress and conceal the material facts. In
 this connection, it was alleged that Coleman, Korshak, and V 0-
 loshen, on the basis of a short press release that was totally uninfor-
 mative, and while suppressing the true facts, attempted to induce
 the Commission immediately to terminate a trading suspension that
had been imposed with respect to Parvin Dohrmann securities.
    In addition to an injunction against future violations of the secu-
 rities laws, the complaint requested that appropriate filings be di-
rected to be made with the Commission and that the defendants be
required to disgorge profits received as a result of their unlawful
conduct.
    In October and November 1969, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York, upon their consent, entered
final judgments of permanent injunction against Parvin Dohrmann,

District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a
judgment of permanent injunction, by consent," against all the de-
fendants in an action instituted by the Commission in October 1969,
against Madison Square Garden Corp. and a wholly owned subsidi-
ary; Goldman, Sachs and Co., a New York broker-dealer; and a
New York investment partnership. The action arose out of the al-
leged conduct of the defendants in connection with a tender offer
that G & W Land and Development Corp. had made for 400,000 of
the 1,300,000outstanding shares of common stock of Roosevelt Race-
way, Inc. At the time of that offer, Madison, through its subsidiary,
held 348,200 Roosevelt shares and had announced its intention to ae-
quire 100 percent ownership of Roosevelt.

 40   S.D.N.Y., 69 Civ. 4364, April 29, 1970.
 41   The defendants did not admit the allegations of the complaint.
                     THIRTY-SIXTH      Al\TNUAL REPORT                   111
     The Commission's complaint alleged that on the day after G & W
  formally made the tender offer, which had earlier been announced,
 Madison issued a press release stating that Madison had reached an
 agreement in principle with Goldman-Sachs whereby Goldman-
 Sachs and certain of its institutional clients would purchase up to
 120,000 shares of Roosevelt common stock. Pursuant to the agree-
 ment, the stock acquired was to be held for 1 year, at which time the
 purchasers would have the right to require Madison to purchase the
 shares from them at 120 percent of their cost.42 The complaint fur-
 ther alleged that the defendants' combined purchases caused the
 market price of Roosevelt common stock to exceed the tender offer
 price during the entire period of the tender offer.
     The Commission claimed that by entering into the arrangement
 with Madison, Goldman-Sachs unlawfully extended and arranged
 for the extension of credit to Madison in violation of Regulation T,
 adopted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
 under Section 7 (c) of the Securities Exchange Act. It was further
 alleged that the defendants' conduct constituted a solicitation or rec-
 ommendation to Roosevelt shareholders to reject the G & 'V tender
 offer and, in connection therewith, that the defendants had failed to
file with the Commission a statement containing the information
specified in Schedule 14D, as required by Section 14(d) (4) of the
Act. The Commission also charged that the defendants had acted as
 a group for the purpose of acquiring, holding, or disposing of Roose-
velt shares, which group, after acquiring Roosevelt shares, held
more than 10 percent of that class of security, but that the group
had not filed with the Commission a statement containing the infor-
mation required by Schedule 13D, adopted pursuant to Section
13(d) (1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13d-1 thereunder. Finally,
the Commission asserted that the defendants had violated Section
10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder as well as Section 14(e) of that
Act.
    In accordance with the relief demanded in the Commission's com-
plaint, the consent judgment declared the agreement between Madi-
son and Goldman-Sachs to be null and void. Goldman-Sachs was or-
dered to dispose in an orderly manner of the Roosevelt shares it had
purchased in connection with that agreement under terms assuring
that it could not profit thereby. The order also contemplated that
clients of Goldman-Sachs, who had purchased Roosevelt shares in
connection with the agreement, would not exercise any right against
Madison that they might have acquired but would, instead, dispose

  42 A few days later, Madison reached a similar agreement, concerning 10,000
shares, with the investment partnership named as a defendant.
 112             SECURITIES     AND   EXCHANGE       COMMISSION

  of their holdings in the open market in an orderly manner. In addi-
  tion, the defendants were enjoined from engaging in any act, prac-
  tice or course of business-or entering any agreement so to engage
  -which operates or would or is intended to operate artificially to in-
  flate the market price of Roosevelt securities in connection with any
 exchange or tender offer. And the judgment further enjoined the de-
  fendants from future violations of the filing requirements of Sec-
  tions 13 and 14 of the Exchange Act with respect to Roosevelt secu-
  rities and ordered them to file with the Commission statements on
 Schedules 13D and 14D with respect to the matters complained of.
     In S.E.O. v. Wriking Food Beverage Systems, Inc., et al.,43an ac-
 tion directed against use of the "spin off" device in alleged violation
  of the Securities Act registration requirements," the Commission
 charged in its complaint that Broadcast Industries Corporation, its
 president, and another individual had organized Wriking and
 shortly thereafter caused 275,000 shares of Wriking stock to be is-
 sued to Broadcast in exchange for a small cash payment and certain
 loan commitments; that, shortly after its receipt of the Wriking
 shares, Broadcast "spun off" 189,455shares to Broadcast's sharehold-
 ers; that such "spin off" caused an immediate public market to be
 developed for 1Vriking stock; that Broadcast's president sold 19,700
shares of 'Yriking stock through several broker-dealers in the over-
 the-counter market at prices ranging from $1 to $17 per share and
sold another 7,000 shares to persons who subsequently sold the stock
 through brokers; that other officers and directors of Broadcast sold
approximately 27,000 additional 'Yriking shares in the over-the-
counter market; and that no registration statement was ever on file
or in effect with the Commission covering the public distribution by
the defendants of the lYriking shares issued in the "spin off." The
defendants, without admitting the allegations of the complaint, con-
sented to entry of a permanent injunction against further violation
of the registration provisions.
    "Spin offs" in violation of the registration provisions were also al-
leged in S.E.O. v. Standard Oomputer & Pictures Oorp., et ril.45 and
S.E.O. v. Met Sports Centers, Imo., et al.46 In those cases the com-
plaints additionally alleged violations of antifraud provisions of the
securities acts resulting from the dissemination of false and mislead-
ing information concerning the issuers of the securities which had

  been spun off. Permanent injunctions were entered by consent in both
  cases.
    During the fiscal year, a final judgment providing for injunctive
 and other relief with respect to alleged antifraud violations was also
 entered, by consent, in the previously reported case of S.E.O. v. Gol-
 conda Mining 00.47 The judgment enjoins Golconda and Harry F.
 Magnuson, a controlling person of Golconda, from fraudulently
 using material information, not generally available to the public,
 that they may obtain by virtue of an insider relationship to any cor-
 poration, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security. In
 addition, they were required to disgorge, with interest, the profits
 which, according to the Commission's complaint, they obtained
 through unlawful use of inside information in violation of Rule
 lOb-5 under the Securities Exchange Act. A court-appointed trus-
 tee has, with the Commission's help, undertaken to locate those per-
 sons with whom the defendants dealt in order to pay them a share of
the fund provided by the defendants pursuant to the decree.
    In S.E.O. v. Dupere/8 the Commission sought to enjoin a former
staff attorney from disclosing to Memory Magnetics International
confidential information obtained in the course of his employment
with the Commission and from being employed by that company,
which had been the subject of an investigation by the Commission.
Relief was also sought against the company and its president to pre-
vent them from obtaining confidential information from Dupere and
from employing him. After a trial on the merits, but prior to a deci-
sion, the action was disposed of by an agreement between the par-
ties, pursuant to which a decree was entered enjoining Dupere from
divulging any confidential or non-public information. The decree
further directed the defendants to comply with their undertaking,
which recited that Dupere's employment by the company had termi-
nated and that he would not be reemployed for 3 years or at any
time when a proceeding under the Federal securities laws should be
pending against the company or its president. At the same time, a
counterclaim seeking to restrain the Commission and two employees
from issuing false press releases and interfering with the company's
business was dismissed, with prejudice, by an order entered upon
consent.

the 31st Annual Report, p. 123. The summary judgment granted to the Com-
mission with respect to defendant Harry F. Magnuson's failure timely to file

    In 8.£.0. 'T. Nortlc American Iiesearcli and Derelopineut OOI']J.t'
 on cross appeals from an order granting a preliminary injunction
 as to some defendants and denying such an injunction as to others,
 the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rendered significant
 rulings concerning the broad applicability of the registration and
 antifraud provisions of the securities laws. It held that a public dis-
 tribution of unregistered securities occurred through the joint action
 of persons in Utah, who bought up a minority of the shares of a
 shell corporation, and other persons, in Canada, to whom the shares
 were sold and who in turn sold the shares back into the United
 States. The district court had found that the scheme had been de-
vised by one Edward White, who had acquired the majority block of
shares but had not, at the time of the action, offered his shares for
sale. The court of appeals held that "where such joint action is
proved the beneficent purposes of the securities acts for the protec-
tion of investors and in the public interest can be accomplished only
by treating such new distributions as jointly conceived and jointly
consummated," 50 and it found those who had aided and abetted sales
by others to be guilty of violations. The court affirmed so much of
the district court's determination 51 as had preliminarily enjoined
North American, 'White, and another principal participant from
further violations of the registration requirements of Sections 5(a)
and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and vacated and remanded for
further consideration the district court's refusal to enter preliminary
injunctions against four peripheral participants in the distribution."
    Although the company's president did not have a central role in
the distribution, the court held that he had "aided and abetted the
furtherance of the unlawful scheme by the major participants" since
he had helped in the preparation of a "Progress Report" that had
been employed as a selling device.53 Concerning two additional par-
ticipants, the court of appeals held, contrary to the district court,
that "no financial stake or motivation is required to support a
charge of Section 5 violation." 54 And, noting that the conduct of
participants in an unlawful distribution may be "classified as joint

  52 The shares of North American had first been offered to the public prior to

the effective date of the Securities Act, but the court found the "grandfather"
exemption of Section 3 (a) (1) unavailable to the defendants because there had
been a "new offering" of North American shares.

 participation or aiding and abetting .... ","5 the court explicitly rec-
 ognized that they may be found to violate Section 5 even absent a
 finding that they are underwriters.
   With reference to the "Progress Report," which was found mate-
rially false and misleading, the court reiterated its holding in S.E.O.
v, Texas Gulf Sulphur 00.,56 that false, misleading, or incomplete
assertions made "in a manner reasonably calculated to influence the
investing public" violate Rule lOb-5 under the Securities Exchange
Act regardless of the motive involved in making the material
public." It held that actions of the principal participants were "pre-
cisely the opposite of [the] diligence and good faith dissemination"
of information by corporate management that might have prevented
violation of the antifraud provisions. The court held that "the Cor-
poration could not abdicate responsibility for ... transmission [of
the Progress Report] to persons not shareholders by claiming that it
... intended the report for the eyes of shareholders only." 58
   The district court's refusal to enjoin the company's president
from antifraud violations was vacated on the basis that his partici-
pation in the preparation of the Progress Report alone
       "is enough to establish the . . . [antifraud] charge ...       if the District
       Court finds that he did not exercise 'due diligence' in ascertaining the ac-
       curacy of the information contained in the Progress Report, irrespective of
       whether he engaged in the sale of any North American shares, intended to
       effect a distribution of the shares, or had any financial interest as a result
       of the sale of the shares." 59
   Other defendants who "were not managerial insiders of North
American," were, the court found, "not casual tippers either", and
the district court's reliance on their motivation and lack of financial
interest was held to be error." With respect to a broker defendant,
the court held that the" 'special relationship' between a broker and
the public creates an implied warranty that the broker has an ade-
quate and reasonable basis in fact for his opinion, and ... the SEC
has the power to enforce that warranty against a broker by an in-
junctive action.... " 61
  After the close of the fiscal year, the district court, upon remand,
applied the principles enunciated by the court of appeals and en-

 tered preliminary injunctions against the four defendants as to
 whom the Commission had taken its appeal."
    In S.E.O. v, Texas Gulf Sulphur 00.,63 upon remand pursuant to
 the previously reported decision of the Court of Appeals for the
 Second Circuit," the United States District Court for the Southern
 District of New York determined that a press release issued by
 Texas Gulf on April 12, 1964, would have been misleading to a rea-
 sonable investor using due care and, since the framers of the release
 had not exercised due diligence in its issuance, that Texas Gulf vio-
 lated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5
 thereunder. Injunctive relief was granted against two individual de-
 fendants who had purchased Texas Gulf stock after issuance of the
 April 12, 1964, release and before a correcting release was issued on
April 16, 1964. The court declined to grant the Commission's request
 for an injunction against the company, however, determining that it
could not conclude, on the record before it, that there was a reasona-
ble likelihood of future violations. For comparable reasons the court
also denied injunctive relief against most of the individual defend-
ants who had been found to have violated Section 10(b) and Rule
10b-5 by having purchased Texas Gulf stock on the basis of mate-
rial undisclosed information.
   The court also held, in accordance with the views of the Commis-
sion, that a district court has authority to deprive defendants of
profits realized through the misuse of inside information and found
it appropriate to do so in this case. Accordingly, those defendants
who had not sold their stock back to Texas Gulf were ordered to
pay the difference between their cost and the mean price of the stock
on the New York Stock Exchange on the day after the issuance of
the correcting press release." The one defendant who was charged
had failed to return illegally acquired stock options to Texas Gulf,
the court ordered that the options be rescinded and canceled.

only for his own profits but also for the profits of his tippees; he
was not, however, charged with the profits of those to whom his tip-
pees had made recommendations. 'W'ith respect to a defendant who

property of Texas Gulf.

    Texas Gulf and the individual defendants are appealing the dis-
 trict court's decision."
     In S.E.O. v. 1I1aoEl'L'ain,67 the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Cir-
 cuit held that the offer of fractional undivided interests in mining
 claims to offshore lands, when coupled with an implied promise to
 litigate the validity of the title to the land being sold for the benefit
 of all purchasers, constituted an "investment contract" and therefore
 a "security," within the meaning of the Securities Act. In affirming
 the entry of an injunction against violations of the registration re-
 quirements of that Act, the court stated that "a defendant's assertion
 of the correctness of his behavior is a ground for restraint," and a
 "court's power to grant injunctive relief survives discontinuance of
 the illegal conduct and can even be utilized without a showing of
 past wrongs." 68
    In S.E.O. v. Boioler." the Commission had adduced evidence
 which showed that the individual defendants had been guilty not
only of numerous violations of the registration and antifraud provi-
sions of the Securities Act but also of mismanagement, self-dealing,
and gross abuses of trust with respect to six corporate defendants.
The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed an order of
the district court," which had granted a permanent injunction
against violations of the Securities Act but denied the Commission's
motion for the appointment of a receiver and had, instead, approved
a plan for reorganization of the corporate defendants proposed by
the individual defendants which would have allowed them to retain
an active management role.
    The court of appeals found that the district court's injunction was
insufficient to protect the public interest, stating that "the limited in-
junction against improper security dealings would provide no brake
against mismanagement, other than security dealings in violation of
the Securities Act .... " 71 It held that, in the absence of a proceed-
ing under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, the appointment of "a
receiver is ... appropriate where necessary to protect the public in-
terest and where it is obvious, as here, that those who have inflicted
serious detriment in the past must be ousted." 72

  66 By a subsequent order, the court granted      the Commission's motion for a
default judgment against one defendant who had failed to respond to the Com-
mission's complaint. No appeal is being taken from this order.

   Participation as Amicus Curiae.- The Commission frequently
 participates as amicus curiae in litigation between private parties
 under the securities laws where it considers it important to present
its views regarding the interpretation of the provisions involved.
 For the most part, such participation is in the appellate courts.
   In Ohrie-Oraft Industries, Inc. v. Bamqor Punta Uorporation J"
the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, sitting en bane, agreed
with the positions taken by the Commission, amicus curiae, (1) that
a press release issued by Bangor Punta Corporation announcing a
forthcoming exchange offer for the shares of Piper Aircraft Corpo-
ration, which release placed a dollar value on the package of securi-
ties Bangor Punta was to offer, constituted a "glm-jumping" offer
for sale of securities in violation of Section 5(c) of the Securities
Act; and (2) that cash purchases of Piper stock made by Bangor
Punta during the exchange offer violated Section 10(b) of the Se-
curities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-6 thereunder.
   The Commission had expressed the view that, in the context of an
impending exchange offer, a press release that fully sets forth all the
facts permitted to be disclosed by Rule 135 under the Securities Act
 (Notice of Certain Proposed Offerings) complies with the full dis-
closure requirements of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 under the Se-
cnrities Exchange Act, even though other material facts pertaining
to the transactions are not contained in the release. The court of ap-
peals did not reach this issue. It found that it was not a material
fact, as defined in S.E.O. v. Texas Culf Sulphur Oompany,74 that a
provision in an agreement with members of the Piper family, which,
among other things, committed Bangor Punta to make the exchange
offer, stated that each share of Piper would be exchangeable for a
package of Bangor securities "having a value, in the written opinion
of the First Boston Corporation, of $80 or more."?"

  74 401 F.2d 833 (C.A. 2, 1968), certiorari denied, 394 U.S. 976 (1969).
   75 Judge Anderson concurred with the majority opinion, but disagreed with

the majority's determination that the dollar valuation was not "material" In his
opinion, which is very closely akin to the argument made in the Commission's
hrief, Judge Anderson states:
      "The Court's holding, in which I concur, is simply that the possible appli-
      cation of disclosure principles discussed by ...   [the Texas Gulf Sulphur]
      cnse is here 'outweighed by the danger that substantial numbers of inves-
      tors were misled by the figure's publication' in a manner violating Rule
      135."
  In a dissenting opinion, Chief Judge Lumbard stated that, in his view, that
information was material and was required to be announced under the ra tlonnle
of TeaJas Gulf.
  Judge Moore concurred in that part of the opinion affirming the trial court's
denial of a preliminary injunction (an issue not argued by the Commission),

    The court also held that cash purchases of the stock of a target
 company by a person whose exchange offer is outstanding with re-
 spect to that stock have a manipulative effect upon the market and
 that the prevention of this kind of manipulation comes within the
 spirit and letter of Rule lOb-G.That rule, among other things, pro-
 hibits the issuer of a security from purchasing the security or "any
 right to purchase any such security" while a distribution of such se-
 curity is in progress. Here, as a result of Bangor Punta's exchange
 offer, the Piper shares carried the right to acquire Bangor Punta se-
 curities.
   In Rekant v. Desser.» the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Cir-
cuit, in accord with views expressed by the Commission, amicus cu-
 riae, held that a stockholder may bring a derivative action under
 Rule lOb-5 based on his corporation's transfer of its own securities
to insiders for inadequate consideration even though there was no al-
legation that any of the directors of the corporation were deceived
as to the nature of the transfer. Because the complaint did not al-
lege that misrepresentations or omissions had influenced the invest-
ment judgment of either the plaintiff or other shareholders, however,
the court held, as the Commission urged, that no claim for individ-
ual or class relief had been stated. For that reason also, the court
did not reach the merits of the Commission's further suggestion that
Rule lOb-5 would be violated if misrepresentations and omissions
influence investment judgment but do not induce an actual purchase
or sale of a security. The court also found it unnecessary to determine
whether there is a private right of action under Section l5(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act, since in this case any cause of action under
that provision and under Hu1elOb-5 overlapped.
Criminal    Proceedings
   The statutes administered by the Commission provide that the
Commission may transmit evidence of violations of any provisions
of these statutes to the Attorney General, who in turn may institute
criminal proceedings. ViTherean investigation by the Commission's
staff indicates that criminal prosecution is warranted, a detailed re-
port is prepared. After careful review by the Office of Criminal
Reference and Special Proceedings and the General Counsel's Office,
the report and the General Counsel's recommendations are consid-
ered by the Commission. If the Commission believes criminal pro-
ceedings are warranted, the case is referred to the Attorney General,

 who in turn refers the case to the appropriate U.S. Attorney. Com-
 mission employees familiar with the case generally assist the U.S.
 Attorney in the presentation of the facts to the grand jury, the
 preparation of legal memoranda for use in the trial, the conduct of
 the trial, and the preparation of briefs on appeal.
    During the past fiscal year, 35 cases were referred to the Depart-
 ment of Justice for prosecution. As a result of these and prior refer-
 rals, 36 indictments were returned against 102 defendants during the
 year. Fifty-five convictions were obtained in 28 cases. Convictions
 were affirmed in 9 cases, and appeals in 12 other cases were pending
 at the close of the year.
    Among the cases in which indictments were obtained during the
 fiscal year, the following are particularly noteworthy: Harry A.
 Lowther, Jr. and three others were indicted 77 for alleged violations
 of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and con-
 spiracy to violate those and other provisions of the Securities Act
 and the Securities Exchange Act in connection with the offer and
sale of common stock of Elkton Company, a corporate shell which
Lowther allegedly revived by causing it to acquire assets of ques-
tionable value. The indictment charges that the price of Elkton
stock was subsequently manipulated by means of fraudulent misrep-
resentations and that a distribution of unregistered shares of the
stock followed.
   Simon J. M:essitte and others were indicted 78 for alleged viola-
tions of the anti-manipulative provisions of the Securities Exchange
Act and the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and conspir-
acy to violate these provisions. This case involved alleged cash pay-
offs to broker-dealers in order to raise the price of Alloys Unlimited,
Inc. stock on the American Stock Exchange.
   Lewis L. Colasurdo and 10 others connected with Crescent
Corporation and Pakco Companies, Inc. were indicted 79 for alleged
conspiracy to violate the disclosure provisions of the Securities Ex-
change Act. In addition, Colasurdo and certain other defendants
were variously charged with mail fraud, wire fraud, false filings
with the Commission, submission of false statements to the United
States Government, and obstruction of justice. The indictment al-
leged that Colasurdo obtained control of Crescent by using the assets
of both Crescent and Pakco, Through his control position, Colasurdo,
aided and abetted by the other defendants, was allegedly able to engage
in and conceal the unauthorized use of the assets of both companies.

     Pedro Manuel Martinez and several others were indicted 80 for vi-
  olations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act, mail fraud,
  and conspiracy. The indictment alleges that Martinez and others
  purchased a majority of the shares of Alaska .Western Life Insur-
  ance Company from another defendant by using the assets of that
  company to finance their purchase. It further alleges that after gain-
  ing control of the company, certain of the defendants converted
  large amounts of the company's assets to their personal use.
     An indictment was returned against J. R. Cissna and others 81
  oharging violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act,
 mail fraud, and conspiracy. Cissna allegedly schemed with others to
  sell investment contracts consisting of 1/8000 fractional undivided
  interests in a proposed recreational development called Recre-Plex.
 It was represented that funds from these sales would be used to
 build the recreational complex when allegedly they were used
 mainly to meet the expenses of Federal Shopping Way, Inc., a com-
 pany of which Cissna was chairman of the board and chief execu-
 tive officer.
    An indictment superseding a previous indictment has been re-
 turned against John B. Walling and others 82 charging violations of
 the mail fraud statute, the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act,
 the stolen property act, and the conspiracy statute. The defendants
 allegedly induced 22 churches to issue bonds by representing that the
 bonds would either be purchased outright or held in escrow by
World Oil and Gas Corporation of Delaware or its affiliated insur-
 ance companies and, in turn, funds would be advanced to the
churches as needed for construction of church facilities. The indict-
ment charges that World Oil, purportedly a multimillion dollar cor-
poration owning Tennessee real estate valued at $26 million, had little
if any assets.
    Convictions were obtained in the following cases, among others:
Ernest A. Bartlett, Jr. was found guilty 83 on each of 26 counts of
an indictment charging violations of the antifraud and registration
provisions of the Securities Act, mail fraud, wire fraud, and con-
spiracy to commit these crimes. The indictment charged that Bart-
lett and others induced investors to purchase securities of Arkansas
Loan & Thrift Corporation by making false statements concerning
the safety of the investment, the financial condition and earnings of
the company, and the sources of dividends. It was also charged that

the defendants falsely claimed that debt securiues issued by Arkan-
sas Loan & Thrift were insured by Savings Guaranty Corporation,
 when in fact that corporation was affiliated with Arkansas Loan &
Thrift and had no assets of its own, and that they diverted assets of
Arkansas Loan & Thrift to their own use and benefit.
   As reported in last year's annual report,84 Frank D. Mills and
Jerome Deutsch were indicted for violations of provisions of the In-
vestment Company Act of 1940.85 During the fiscal year Mills
pleaded guilty to violating Section 17(d) of that Act, relating to
joint ventures between investment companies and their affiliates, and
Deutsch was convicted of aiding and abetting violations of Section
17(e) of the Act, the "kickback" provision. Deutsch was found to
have made an unlawful payment to Mills, at a time when the latter
was vice president and portfolio manager of an investment company,
in the form of a bargain price on the purchase of a security from a
company of which Deutsch was an officer.
   In a case involving a widespread distribution of unregistered
shares of Petron Corporation by the use of nominees and the use of
selected brokerage houses which employed "boiler-room" tactics and
received kickbacks for selling the securities, Forrest and Donald
Parrott were found guilty 86 on charges of conspiracy to sell unreg-
istered securities, sale of unregistered securities, fraud in the sale
of securities, mail fraud and fraud by wire. Their convictions were
subsequently affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit."
   In a prosecution arising out of transactions in the securities of
Eastern Mass. Street Railway Company;" Vincent Carrano pleaded
guilty to an indictment charging violations of the antifraud provi-
sions of the Securities Exchange Act and mail fraud, and Gordon
M. Copp and Allan L. D'Honau were convicted after trial of viola-
tions of the antifraud and anti-manipulative provisions of the Se-
curities Exchange Act, mail fraud, and conspiracy. The indictment
charged that the defendants placed orders with various broker-deal-
ers for the purchase of securities but paid for the securities only if
the market price of the securities rose and refused payment when
the market price of those securities dropped.
   Harold N. Leitman, former president and chairman of the board
of VTR, Inc., was found guilty 89 under an indictment charging him

  with filing false financial information for VTR with the Commis-
  sion and the American Stock Exchange. In a related matter, Alvin
  Leitman and Milton Rubin each pleaded guilty 90 to two counts of
  an information charging that they aided and abetted violations of
  the rules and regulations governing filings with the Commission,
  which would have required that schedules be filed with the Commis-
  sion showing the indebtedness of certain insiders to VTR.
     The Commission has continued its efforts to assure that injunctions
  obtained by it are adhered to. During the past fiscal year, 10 persons
  and companies were convicted of criminal contempt for violating in-
  junctions, and, in one case, also for violation of a court order direct-
  ing compliance with a Commission subpoena. Substantial prison
 terms and fines were imposed on the defendants. A number of other
 contempt cases were pending at the close of the year.
     Organized Crime Program.-The         Commission has always given
 priority to the investigation of cases where there is an indication
 that organized crime may be involved. Pursuant to Executive Order
 11534,91 the Chairman of the Commission was designated to be a
 member of the National Council on Organized Crime. In that capac-
 ity, the Chairman will join with other government officials in seek-
 ing to formulate a national strategy for the elimination of organized
 crime.
    The Commission maintains a close liaison with the Organized
 Crime and Racketeering Section of the Department of Justice and
submits quarterly reports relating to organized crime investigations.
During the 1969 fiscal year, the Commission had placed four enforce-
ment staff members on the New York Strike Force against organized
crime. Current plans call for the placing of additional enforcement
personnel on certain other Strike Forces. During the 1970 fiscal year,
the Commission established an organized crime section in its head-
quarters officeto focus on the involvement of organized crime in the
securities markets. This unit acts as a "back-up" unit to the various
Strike Forces and as an enforcement unit investigating certain secu-
rities violations in which persons with organized crime associations
are believed to be involved.
    Proposed Swiss Treaty.-Since       approximately January 196V, a
representative of the Commission has participated with the State
Department and other agencies of the United States Government in
discussions looking toward a possible Treaty of Mutual Assistance
in Criminal Matters between the United States and Switzerland. It
is believed that such a Treaty would be of assistance to the Commis-

sion in dealing with problems presented by the use of Swiss finan-
cial institutions in connection with securities transactions taking
place in the United States.
  The Commission's representative has participated in a series of in-
formal discussions between U.S. and Swiss officials in 1Vashington,
D.C. and in Bern, Switzerland. These meetings have resulted in an
informal agreement by the working group on an English text of a
draft treaty. ""Vorkon this matter is continuing.
   DISCIPLINARY    ACTION BY SELF-REGULATORY        ORGANIZATIONS
Exchanges
   Although the Exchange Act does not provide for Commission re-
view of disciplinary action by exchanges, each national securities ex-
change reports to the Commission actions taken against members
and member firms and their associated persons for violations of any
rule of the exchange or of the Exchange Act or of any rule of regu-
lation under that Act.
   During the fiscal year, eight exchanges reported 129 separate ac-
tions, including impositions of fines in 78 cases ranging from $100 to
$150,000,with total fines aggregating $735,900; the suspension from
membership of 20 individuals; and the censure of 21 member firms.
These exchanges also reported the imposition of various sanctions
against 86 registered representatives and other employees of member
firms.
NASD
    The Commission receives from the NASD copies of its decisions
 in all disciplinary actions against members and registered represent-
 atives. In general, such actions are based on allegations that the re-
spondents violated specified provisions of the NASD's Rules of Fair
 Practice. Where violations are found, the NASD may impose one or
more sanctions upon a member, including expulsion, suspension, fine,
or censure. If the violator is an individual, his registration as a rep-
resentative may be suspended or revoked, he may be suspended or
barred from being associated with any member, and he may be fined
and/or censured. Under Section 15A(b) (4) of the Exchange Act
and the NASD's by-laws, no broker-dealer may be admitted to or
continued in NASD membership without Commission approval if he
has been suspended or expelled from membership in the NASD or a
national securities exchange; he is barred or suspended from associa-
tion with a broker or dealer or with members of the NASD or an
exchange; his registration as a broker-dealer has been denied, sus-
pended, or revoked; he has been found to be a cause of certain sanc-
tions imposed upon a broker-dealer by the Commission, the NASD,
                   THIRTY-SIXTH    ANNUAL    REPORT                125
  or an exchange; or he has associated with him any person subject to
  one of the above disqualifications.
     During the past fiscal year the NASD reported to the Commission
  its final disposition of disciplinary complaints against 179 member
  firms and 117 individuals associated with them. 'With respect to 10
  members and 18 associated persons, complaints were dismissed be-
  cause the alleged violations had not been established. In the remain-
  ing cases, violations were found and penalties were imposed on 169
  members and 99 registered representatives or other individuals. The
  maximum penalty of expulsion from membership was imposed
  against 12 members, and 16 members were suspended from member-
 ship for periods ranging from 2 days to 2 years. In many of these
 cases, substantial fines were also imposed. In another 137 cases, mem-
 bers were fined amounts ranging from $100 to $40,000. In 4 cases,
 the only sanction imposed was censure, although censure was usually
 a secondary penalty where a more severe penalty was also imposed.
     Various penalties were also imposed on associated individuals
 found in violation of NASD rules. The registrations of 27 registered
 representatives were revoked, and 30 representatives had their regis-
 trations suspended for periods ranging from 5 days to 2 years. Fines in
 various amounts were also imposed against many revoked or suspended
 representatives. In addition, 39 other representatives were censured
 and/or fined amounts ranging from $100 to $10,000. Three individu-
 als were barred from association with any NASD member.
     Commission Review of NASD Disciplinary Action.-Section
 15A(g) of the Exchange Act provides that disciplinary actions by
 the NASD are subject to review by the Commission on its own mo-
tion or on the timely application of any aggrieved person. This Sec-
tion also provides that upon application for or institution of review
by the Commission the effectiveness of any penalty imposed by the
NASD is automatically stayed pending Commission review, unless
the Commission otherwise orders after notice and opportunity for
hearing. Section 15A(h) of the Act defines the scope of the Commis-
sion's review. If the Commission finds that the disciplined party
committed the acts found by the NASD and thereby violated the
rules specified in the determination and that such conduct was incon-
sistent with just and equitable principles of trade, the Commission
must sustain the NASD's action unless it finds that the penalties im-
posed are excessive or oppressive, in' which case it must cancel or re-
duce them.
    At the start of the fiscal year, three NASD disciplinary decisions
were pending before the Commission on review. During the year
seven additional cases were brought up for review. Two cases were
126           SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

disposed of by the Commission. In one case the Commission sustained
in full the disciplinary action taken by the NASD, and in the other
it modified the penalties." Eight cases were pending at the end of
the year.
   Commission Review of NASD Action on Membership.-As pre-
viously noted, Section 15A(b) (4) of the Act and the bylaws of
the NASD provide that, except where the Commission finds it
appropriate in the public interest to approve or direct to, the con-
trary, no broker or dealer may be admitted to or continued in mem-
bership if he, or any person associated with him, is under any of the
several disabilities specified in the statute or the NASD by-laws. A
Commission order approving or directing admission to or continu-
ance in Association membership, notwithstanding a disqualification
under Section 15A (b) (4) of the Act or under an effective Associa-
tion rule adopted under that Section or Section 15A(b) (3), is gener-
ally entered only after the matter has been submitted initially to the
Association by the member or applicant for membership. The Asso-
ciation in its discretion may then file an application with the
Commission on behalf of the petitioner. If the Association refuses to
sponsor such an application, the broker or dealer may apply directly
to the Commission for an order directing the Association to admit
or continue him in membership, At the beginning of the fiscal year,
one application for approval of admission to or continuance in mem-
bership was pending. During the year, 8 additional applications
were filed, and 4 were approved, leaving 5 applications pending at
the year's end.
       COOPERATION     WITH OTHER ENFORCEMENT           AGENCIES
   In recent years the Commission has given increased emphasis to
the coordination of its enforcement activities with those of the var-
ious state and local authorities, the self-regulatory agencies, and for-
eign securities agencies. This program encompasses the referral to
state and local authorities for investigation and prosecution or other
action of those violations where the amounts of money or the num-
ber of investors involved do not appear to be substantial enough to
warrant development of the case at the Federal level. The Commis-
sion frequently provides manpower assistance to these authorities in
the development of such cases. In addition, the Commission's re-
gional officeshave taken steps to improve the coordination of inspec-
tions and other activities with state securities administrators and
with the NASD in those areas where their respective jurisdictions

(February 13, 1970).
                     THIRTY -SIXTH   ANNUAL REPORT                127
 overlap. Staff members of the Commission and of certain state au-
 thorities have conducted joint inspections which have made the en-
 tire inspection program more effective.
    During the fiscal year, the Commission continued its program of
 cooperative regional enforcement conferences at each of its regional
 offices.These conferences, during which Commission personnel meet
 with personnel from state securities agencies, post officeinspectors,
 Federal, state, and local prosecutors and local representatives of
 self-regulatory agencies such as the NASD, are designed to promote
the exchange of information concerning regional enforcement prob-
lems, the development of methods of increasing cooperation and
communication, and the elimination of needless effort and waste of
manpower and other resources in the regulation of the securities
markets. Although the Commission served as the primary agency in
establishing those cooperative enforcement conferences, they have
progressed to the point where state securities agencies frequently
serve as hosts of the programs.
    For the past 4 years, the Commission has held one or two-week
nationwide enforcement training sessions at its headquarters office
in Washington, D.C. to which it has invited staff members of state
and foreign securities agencies. The 1970 session was attended by
representatives of various Federal, state, and Canadian agencies, as
well as by staff members from each of the Commission's offices
throughout the country.
Section of Securities Violations
   The Commission's Section of Securities Violations provides one of
 the means for cooperation on a continuing basis with other agencies
having enforcement responsibilities. This Section acts as a clearing
house for information regarding enforcement actions in securities
matters taken by state and Canadian authorities, by other govern-
mental and self-regulatory agencies, and by the Commission. In ad-
dition to handling requests for specific information, the Section pub-
lishes a periodic Bulletin which is sent to contributing agencies and
to other enforcement and regulatory organizations. The Bulletin
contains current information which is a matter of public record re-
garding the institution and disposition of remedial and enforcement
proceedings.
   Among other things, the data in the SV files (which are main-
tained in a computer) constitute a valuable tool for screening appli-
cants for registration as securities or commodities brokers or dealers
as well as applicants for loans from such agencies as the Small
Business Administration and the Economic Development Adminis-
tration of the Department of Commerce.
 128              SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

   During the fiscal year, the Section received 4,210 letters either
providing or requesting information and sent out 2,631 communica-
tions to cooperating agencies. State and Canadian securities adminis-
trators reported 118 criminal actions, 27 injunctive actions, 168 ac-
tions in the nature of cease and desist orders, and 173 other
administrative orders, such as denials, suspensions, and revocations
of issuers, broker-dealers, and salesmen. As of the end of the fiscal
year, the number of names in the SV files totalled 78,465, represent-
ing a net increase of 209 during the year.
         ENFORCEMENT       PROBLEMS WITH RESPECT TO FOREIGN
                                 SECURmES
    The past fiscal year was marked by extensive efforts by various
 promoters and others to distribute foreign securities in the United
 States without complying with the registration and disclosure provi-
 sions of the Securities Act and generally in violation of antifraud
 provisions of the securities laws. In some instances companies which
 were represented as having issued the securities were in fact non-ex-
 istent. Known securities law violators, as well as individuals associ-
 ated with organized crime, appeared to be connected with some of
the more flagrantly fraudulent offerings of foreign securities.
    To alert brokers and dealers, financial institutions, investors, and
 others to possible unlawful distributions of foreign securities, the
 Commission maintains and publicizes a Foreign Restricted List. That
list is comprised of the names of foreign companies whose securities
the Commission has reason to believe recently have been, or cur-
rently are being, offered for public sale and distribution in the
United States in violation of the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. The number of companies on the list increased from
39 at June 30, 1969, to 46 at the end of the 1970 fiscal year. Most
brokers and dealers refuse to effect transactions in securities issued
by companies on the list; however, this does not necessarily prevent
promoters from illegally offering such securities directly to investors
in the United States, either in person or by mail.
    One of the names placed on the Foreign Restricted List during
fiscal year 1970 was San Salvador Savings and Loan Co., Ltd., a
purported Bahamian company." The Commission had reason to be-
lieve that $1,600,000 in 11 percent bearer bonds, issued under that
name, had been offered for sale in the United States. The Govern-
ment of the Bahamas reported that a corporation by this name had
changed its name to Regency Properties, Ltd. in 1965, indicating
that securities printed in 1969 using the San Salvador name may be

                         THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT                    129
counterfeit. The Bahamian government further reported that there
was no record of the required government authorization to issue and
sell bonds abroad. Moreover, the certificates purporting to represent
the bonds had no coupons attached.
   In a case involving the distribution of securities of Paulpic Gold
Mines, Ltd., a Canadian corporation, it appeared that two residents
of the United States, after purchasing 450,000 shares of stock of
Paulpic in Canada at prices ranging from 18 to 43 cents per share,
induced 76 investors in California and Ohio to purchase 70,000unreg-
istered shares from the Canadian broker for the two individuals at
prices of $3.00 and $3.50 per share although no intervening event
had occurred in the affairs of the company to warrant such increase
in the price of the shares. The Ontario Securities Commission
alerted the staff of this Commission to these activities, and the com-
pany was placed on the Foreign Restricted List.v
   The Bank of Sark and First Liberty Fund, Ltd. were also placed
on the Foreign Restricted List 95 during the fiscal year. Securities
purporting to be bank drafts and certificates of deposit of the
"Bank of Sark" and shares of First Liberty Fund, Ltd. had been of-
fered in the United States by the same promoters. The available evi-
dence indicates that the purported bank is merely a corporate shell
and has consistently refused to pay bank drafts sent to it for collec-
tion or to honor the certificates of deposit. The assets of First Lib-
erty, a Bahamian corporation, were represented to be in the custody
of the "Bank of Sark."
   On Jnne 30, 1970, the following companies were on the Foreign
Restricted List:
  94 Securities Act Release No. 5044 (February 6, 1970). The Ontario Commis-

sion conducted extensive public hearings and published a lengthy opinion ex-
posing the fraudulent character of this promotion.

        DISQUALIFICATION            FROM PRACTICE BEFORE               COMMISSION
    In Paui JJI. [{aufman,06 the Commission, pursuant to Rule 2(e) of
 its Rules of Practice, temporarily denied the privilege of appearing
 or practicing before it to a member of the New York bar, pending
 disposition of his appeal from criminal convictions of conspiracy to
 violate and violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)
 of the Securities Act of 1933. The Commission rejected Kaufman's
 contention that his convictions could not be considered evidence of
lack of "character or integrity" within the meaning of Rule 2 (e) be-
cause, pending disposition of his appeal, they were not final. The
Commission stated that "[i]f the public is to be protected and the
public's confidence in the legal profession and in this Commission
maintained, an attorney convicted of a serious crime such as securi-
ties fraud should not be permitted to hold himself out as entitled to
represent others in securities matters before us merely because an
appeal is pending." The Commission's order further provided that
Kaufman's disqualification would become final if and when any of
his convictions were affirmed and no longer subject to direct
review."
    The Kaufman case indicated the need for an expeditious disquali-
fication procedure in situations such as that involved in that case
and in comparable situations. Accordingly, in September 1970, the
Commission amended Rule 2 (e) of its Rules of Practice to provide
for the automatic suspension from appearance or practice before it
of (1) any attorney who has been suspended or disbarred by a court
of the United States or in any State, Territory, District, Common-
wealth, or Possession; (2) any accountant, engineer, or other expert
who has had his license to practice revoked or suspended by any
State, Territory, District, Commonwealth, or Possession; or (3) any
person who has been convicted of a felony or of any misdemeanor
involving moral turpitude." The suspension will take effect regard-
less of whether an appeal from the underlying suspension, revoca-
tion, disbarment, or conviction is pending or could be taken, pro-
vided, however, that if all grounds for the underlying action are
removed, the suspension from practice before the Commission will
be lifted upon appropriate application. The revised rule also pro-
vides that the Commission may suspend :from practice any person
who, after notice and opportunity for hearing, is found to have will-

  The Commission has also invited comments 99 on a proposal fur-
ther to amend Rule 2 (e) to provide that any person who has been
permanently enjoined from violating the federal securities laws, or
who has been found by the Commission or any court to have will-
fully violated, or willfully aided and abetted violations of, the fed-
eral securities laws, may be ordered by the Commission to show
cause why he should not be censured or disqualified from appearing

          REGULATION OF INVESTMENT COMPANIES

    In broad terms, an investment company is any arrangement by
 which a group of persons invests funds in an entity that is itself en-
 gaged in investing in securities. Investment companies are important
 vehicles for public participation in the securities markets. They en-
 able small as well as large investors to participate in a profession-
 ally managed and diversified portfolio of securities.
    The Investment Company Act of 1940 sets forth the Commission's
 responsibilities in protecting investors in such companies.' It
 provides a comprehensive framework of regulation which, among
 other things, prohibits changes in the nature of an investment com-
 pany's business or in its investment policies without shareholder ap-
 proval, contains prohibitions against theft or conversion of assets or
 gross abuse of trust, and provides specific controls to eliminate or
mitigate inequitable capital structures. The Act also requires that an
investment company disclose its financial condition and investment
policies; requires that management contracts be submitted to share-
holders for approval; prohibits underwriters, investment bankers, or
brokers from constituting more than a minority of an investment
company's board of directors; regulates the custody of investment
company assets; and provides specific controls designed to protect
against unfair transactions between investment companies and their
affiliates.
   In addition to complying with the requirements of the Investment
Company Act, an investment company must comply with the Securi-
ties Act of 1933 when offering its securities, and it is subject to cer-
tain provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including
those relating to proxy and tender offer solicitations and insider
trading and reporting.

   As of June 30, 1970, there were 1,328 investment companies regis-
tered under the Act, whose assets had an aggregate market value of
approximately $56.1 billion. Compared with corresponding totals at
June 30, 1969, these figures represent an over-all decrease of approx-
imately $16.4 billion, or about 23 percent, in the market value of as-
sets although there was an increase of 161, or almost 14 percent, in
the number of registered companies.

   As the table shows, 20, or approximately 11 percent, of the newly
registered companies were variable annuity separate accounts of in-
surance companies." Including these companies, there were 70 active
variable annuity separate accounts registered at June 30, 1970, con-
sisting of 21 unit investment trusts and 49 management open-end in-
vestment companies. A significant part of the Commission's regula-
tory effort with respect to variable annuities has involved the
application of the requirements of the Investment Company Act to
the patterns and procedures which have grown up in the insurance
industry.
                            INVESTMENT                COMPANY ASSETS
  The following table sets forth the number of investment compa-
nies registered under the Investment Company Act and their esti-
mated aggregate assets, in round amounts, at the end of each fiscal
year, 1941through 1970.
  2 The applicability of the requirements of the Investment Company Act to
variable annuity contracts was discussed in prior annual reports. Typically, a
variable annuity contract provides payments for-life commencing on a selected
date with the amounts of the payments varying with the investment perform-
ance of equity securities which are set apart by the insurance company in a
separate account which is registered with the Commission as an investment
company. The separate accounts now registered are either open-end manage-
ment companies or unit investment trusts.

        NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE INVESTMENT COMPANY FIELD
 Investment Companies Sponsored by Foreign Interests

      Fund Managed by an Affiliate of the French Government.-     During
  the year an investment company managed by an affiliate of the
  French Goyernment, SoGen International Fund, Inc., filed a regis-
  tration statement and commenced operations. The Fund's investment
  adviser and principal underwriter is SaGen International Corpora-
  tion, all of whose outstanding stock is owned by Societe Gencralc,
  one of France's largest banks and its affiliate, Societe Generale Alsa-
  cienne de Banque, Strasbourg, France. Societe Generale is owned by
 the French Government."
     The Fund's prospectus states that the adviser conducts its opera-
  tion independent of Societe Generale and neither Societe Generale
 nor the French Government supervises the Fund's managcment or
 investment practices or policies.
    Shares of the Fund are offered for sale both in the United States
 and abroad. Foreign investors are able to purchase Fund shares di-
 rectly or may purchase Bearer Depository Receipts representing reg-
 istered shares of the Fund which will be issued by a Luxembourg
subsidiary of the adviser.
    The Fund's investment policy allows it to invest in companies or-
ganized and operating in the United States or elsewhere in the free
world. 'Vhile the Interest Equalization Tax is in effect, most or sub-
stantially all of the Fund's investments will be in companies orga-
nized in the United States. Foreign investments will also be limited
by any mandatory guidelines that the Federal Reserve Board may
adopt pursuant to Executive Order. To the extent that the Fund in-
vests in a foreign issuer its investment policies allow it to engage in
forward currency transactions in an attempt to protect the Fund
from devaluation of that country's currency. This policy may be
used only defensively and the Fund may not sell forward currency
of a particular country to an extent greater than the then current
value of its investment in issuers incorporated or operating in that
country.

Commission Policy on Restricted Securities
   During the fiscal year, the Commission issued an official policy
statement on the acquisition and holding of restricted securities by
investment companies." These securities, sometimes called "letter
stock," are securities acquired in private placements or which for
some other reason require registration under the Securities Act of
1933 before they may be resold to the public. The Commission's re-
lease discussed the problems of valuation of such securities, problems
of disclosure regarding such valuation, and problems of portfolio
management where restricted securities are included in the portfolio.
The release also expressed the Commission's view that a 10 percent
limitation (in terms of net assets) on holdings of restricted securities
or other assets not readily marketable should be maintained by an open-
end investment company so as to avoid liquidity problems. A later
release 6 made clear that the disclosure requirements for unregistered
securities pertained not only to registration statements, but also to re-
ports filed with the Commission or distributed to shareholders, and to
sales literature and proxy statements.
Foreign Sales Guidelines
   On June 23, 1970, the Commission published guidelines on the
applicability of the Federal securities laws to the offer and sale out-
side the United States of shares of registered open-end investment
companies." As discussed in the last annual report," the Commission
had proposed the guidelines in February 1969, in response to the
rapid expansion of many registered domestic investment companies
into overseas markets and the concern that some foreign govern-
ments exhibited about the activities of such companies in their coun-
tries. The purpose of the guidelines is not only to publicize the Com-
mission's views on the applicability of the statutes which it
administers to sales of registered open-end investment company
shares outside the United States to foreign investors, but also to set
forth what are believed to be appropriate standards for the market-
ing of United States investment company securities abroad.
   The guidelines will insure that substantially the same disclosure
required by the Federal securities laws for American investors will

 generally be available to foreign investors purchasing shares of
 American registered investment companies. Such disclosure at the
 point of sale helps protect the United States securit ies market as a
 whole by insuring that foreign investors will not seek redemptions
 because of later realization that they had been inadequately in-
 formed about their investment. Loss of confidence in the integrity of
 American registered investment companies could trigger widespread
 redemptions resulting in losses to foreign and domestic investors and
 damage to the United States securities market.
    The guidelines call for Securities Act registration of open-end in-
 vestment company shares sold abroad and for the use in connection
 with foreign sales of a prospectus substantially similar to the one
 used domestically. The prospectus used in any foreign country
 should be printed in a language readily understood by that segment
 of the foreign public being solicited, and dealer agreements with
 foreign broker-dealers should provide for prospectus delivery to all
 purchasers. Copies of the prospectus used abroad along with the
 English version of the prospectus upon which the foreign language
 prospectus is based are to be filed with the Commission.
   In the area of advertising, the U.S. distributor is expected to seek
 compliance by foreign dealers with the standards of the Commis-
 sion's Statement of Policy." by means of dealer agreements. Some
 deviation from the standards for tombstone advertisements set forth
in Rule 134 under the Securities Act would be permitted as de-
manded by local custom, but, to the extent possible, all advertise-
ments should be within the bounds of the Statement of Policy.
   The guidelines also state that the regulatory requirements of the
Investment Company Act are generally applicable to the sale of
shares of open-end companies to foreign nationals abroad. For ex-
ample, the guidelines indicate that applications for exemptions
under the Investment Company Act must be filed and granted to
permit sales of shares in foreign countries at prices other than the
public offering price in effect in this country. In accordance with
this guideline provision, several funds have been exempted from
Section 22(d) for foreign sales of their shares at prices which in-
clude sales loads different from those charged for domestic sales."

Amendment of Rule 22d-1
   On June 5, 1970, the Commission published notice 11 of a proposal
to amend Rule 22d-1 under the Act.12 Paragraph (h) of the Rule
presently allows sales of open-end investment company shares at a
reduced load or no sales load at all to directors, officersand partners
of the investment company, its investment adviser or principal un-
derwriter, and bona fide full-time employees or sales representatives
of any of the foregoing who have acted as such for at least 90 days,
and to any trust, pension, profit-sharing or other benefit plan for
such persons. The provision was designed to permit such sales for
the purpose of promoting employee incentive and good will and was
adopted at a time when most investment advisers and principal un-
derwriters for registered investment companies had relatively few
employees.
  Because of the way Paragraph (h) is written, however, there are
certain anomalies in its applicability. For example, it permits em-
ployees of a life insurance company which acts as investment adviser
or principal underwriter for an investment company to benefit from
the reduced or eliminated sales load, while employees of an insur-
ance company which performs the same services through subsidiaries
or affiliates are not eligible for such benefits.
  Further, in recent years an increasing number of investment ad-
visers and principal underwriters of investment companies have be-
come part of large complexes of companies, and as a result, a num-
ber of applications have been filed for exemption from the
provisions of Section 22(d) of the Act to permit sales at reduced or
no load to employees of subsidiary or affiliated companies, many of
whom had no connection with the investment company business."
  As a consequence, the Commission proposed to restrict the cate-
gory of favored persons by limiting sales of open-end investment
company shares at a reduced or eliminated sales load to officers,
directors or partners of the investment company, its investment ad-
viser or principal underwriter, employees or sales representatives of
the foregoing who spend more than half of their working time ren-
dering investment advisory services to the investment company or

  11  Investment Company Act Release No. 6069.
  12  Section 22(d) prohibits a registered investment company, its principal un-
derwriter, or a dealer in its redeemable securities from selling such securities
to "any person" except at a current public offering price described in the pros-
pectus.
   13 The first of the applications, that of Transamerica Capital Fund, Inc., was
discussed in the 35th Annual Report, p. 136.
                       TIDRTY-SIXTH      ANNUAL REPORT                      141
 selling its shares, and any trust, pension, profit-sharing or other ben-
 efit plan for the benefit of such persons."
 Amendment of Rule 17d-1
       In April 1970, the Commission published a proposal to amend
  Rule 17d-1 under the Investment Company Act so as to clarify the
  applicability of the Rule to stock option and stock purchase plans of
  companies controlled by registered investment companies and to ex-
  empt from the requirement of filing an application under the Rule
  transactions in connection with such plans where no affiliated person
  of any investment company, investment adviser or principal under-
  writer participates therein. The amendment was adopted substan-
 tially as proposed following the close of the fiscal year.15
     Section 17(d) of the Act prohibits any affiliated person of or prin-
 cipal underwriter for a registered investment company from
 effecting any transaction in which the registered company, or a com-
 pany controlled by it, is a joint or a joint and several participant
 with the affiliated person or principal underwriter in contravention
 of any rules prescribed by the Commission for the purpose of limit-
 ing or preventing participation by the registered or controlled com-
 pany on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of
other participants.
    Rule 17d-1 prohibits affiliated persons of and principal underwri-
tel'S for registered investment companies from effecting any transac-
tion in connection with any joint enterprise or other joint arrange-
ment or profit-sharing plan in which any such registered company,
or a company controlled by such registered company, is a partici-
pant unless an application regarding such joint enterprise has been
filed with, and granted by, the Commission.
    As amended, the Rule enables operating companies controlled by
registered investment companies to adopt stock option or stock pur-
chase plans for their officers, directors, or employees who are not af-
filiated persons of any investment company which is an affiliated
person of the controlled company, or of the investment adviser or

   ,. In almost all instances where the Commission granted exemptive orders
from Section 22(d), the orders contained an express condition that if an
amendment to Rule 22d-l more restrictive than the terms of the orders were
adopted, the orders would automatically terminate and the amended rule apply.
The release announcing the proposed amendment to the Rule indicated that
where orders have been granted without this condition the Commission would
institute appropriate proceedings for revocation or modification of such orders
so that all companies would be equally subject to the amended Rule

principal underwriter of such an investment company, without seek-
ing the approval of the Commission. The exemptive status of profit-
sharing plans of controlled companies was continued. As to all
plans, however, the availability of the exemption is predicated on
the conditions that participants in the plan (1) must not be affiliated
with the investment company, its adviser, or principal underwriter,
and (2) must not have been affiliated with any of them during the
life of the plan and for 6 months prior to institution of the profit-
sharing plan or the purchase of stock pursuant to a stock purchase
plan or the granting of options pursuant to a stock option plan.
   This amendment was not intended to modify the prohibition con-
tained in the Act against the issuance of stock options or the adop-
tion of stock purchase plans either directly or indirectly by regis-
tered investment companies.
Rules Relating to Variable Annuities and Separate Accounts
   Because of their special nature, variable annuity separate accounts
require exemptions from a number of provisions of the Invest-
ment Company Act. As a result of experience gained in processing
a number of applications for exemptions, the Commission concluded
that it would be appropriate to provide, through the promulgation
of rules under the Investment Company Act, certain limited exemp-
tions which had previously been granted by individual exemptive or-
ders. Accordingly, several rules were adopted on July 10, 1969.16 On
April 30, 1970, the Commission published for comment four pro-
posed rules which would provide certain additional exemptions."
These rules would eliminate the need for preparing, filing, and proc-
essing routine applications and provide a further specification of the
manner in which relevant regulatory provisions will be applied in
connection with the organization and operation of separate accounts.
                 APPLICATIONS FOR COMMISSION ACTION
  Under Section 6(c) of the Act, the Commission, by rules and reg-
ulations, upon its own motion or by order upon application, may ex-
empt any person, security, or transaction from any provision of the
Act if and to the extent such exemption is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors
and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the
Act. Other Sections, such as 6(d), 9(b), 10(f), 17(b), 17(d), and
23(c), contain specific provisions and standards pursuant to which
the Commission may grant exemptions from particular sections of
the Act or may approve certain types of transactions. Also, under

 certain provisions of Sections :2, :3, and 8, the Connnission may deter-

   The Equity Corporation; a closed-end non-diversified investment
company, applied pursuant to Section 8(f) of the Investment Com-
pany Act for an order declaring that it had ceased to be an invest-
ment company and terminating its registration.
   In denying the application, the Commission found that the Equity
management, in violation of Section 13(a) (4) of the Act, had
changed the nature of Equity's business so as to cease to be an in-
vestment company prior to obtaining a shareholders' vote of
approval." The Commission's opinion stated, however, that if Equi-
ty's management still desired that it not be an investment company,
it should present to the shareholders for their vote the question of
whether or not they wished Equity to be an investment company in
accordance with "a concrete plan prepared in good faith sufficient to

   18   Investment         Company Act Release No. 6000 (March 5, 1970).
144            SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

 constitute a real alternative of a viable investment company busi-
 ness."
    Equity filed a petition for rehearing which, among other things,
 requested clarification of the stockholder-vote procedure and also
 presented a plan which it considered might satisfy the Commission's
 requirements. Following objections to the plan by the staff and
 a group of objecting stockholders who participated in the proceed-
 ings, Equity submitted an alternative plan developed as a result of
 discussions with the staff. The objecting stockholders also opposed
 this plan. The Commission denied the petition for rehearing but
 ruled that the alternative plan satisfied the conditions set forth in
 its principal decision, authorized Equity to submit it to a vote of its
 shareholders, and stated that, if the plan were disapproved by the
 shareholders, it would enter a deregistration order upon appropriate
 application."
    An application under Section 8 (f) was also filed by I ntermark I n-
 vesting Oompany, Inc., which is registered as a closed-end invest-
 ment company;" In September 1968, Intermark had obtained share-
 holders' approval of its proposal to surrender its license as a small
 business investment company and pursue a program designed to
change the nature of its business to that of an operating company.
Thereafter it acquired all of the outstanding stock or assets of ap-
proximately twenty operating companies. In 10 of the acquisitions,
Intermark issued "earnouts"-that      is, in addition to the issuance of
shares in exchange for the outstanding shares of companies acquired,
Intermark agreed to issue additional shares conditioned upon the
earnings of the acquired companies over the succeeding three years.
    Following a hearing the hearing examiner concluded that the ap-
plication should be denied. He found that the earnouts were "senior
securities," within the meaning of the Act, and had been issued in
violation of Section 18(c) of the Act and were therefore voidable.
The examiner also found that Intermark's proxy statement for the
September 1968 meeting was false and misleading in various re-
spects, thus vitiating the vote of shareholders required under Section
13(a) (4) oftheAct.
   The Commission granted petitions for review of the examiner's
initial decision filed by Intermark and the Commission's staff.
   Alleghany Oorporation filed an application during the year for an
order pursuant to Section 8 (f) declaring that it had ceased to be an
investment company as defined in the Act.21 In January 1970, the

  Interstate Commerce Commission authorized Alleghany to acquire
  the operating rights and property of Jones Motor Co., Inc. and its
  subsidiary, Erie Trucking Company, both motor carriers. Alleghany
 asserted that by virtue of its acquisition of Jones it was subject to reg-
 ulation under the Interstate Commerce Act as a motor carrier and
 had thereby ceased to be an investment company by virtue of the
 provisions of Section 3(c) (9) of the Act which excludes from the
 definition of an investment company any company subject to regula-
 tion under the Interstate Commerce Act.
    After the close of the fiscal year, the Commission granted the re-
 quested order.>
    Midnite Mines, Inc. filed an application pursuant to Section
 3 (b) (2) of the Act which authorizes the Commission to exempt from
 the Act any company which is primarily engaged in a business or busi-
 nesses other than that of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or
 trading in securities, either directly or through majority-owned sub-
 sidiaries or controlled companies conducting similar types of busi-
 nesses. Midnite's principal asset is a 49 percent interest in Dawn
 Mining Company which is engaged in operating the "Midnite
 Mine," a uranium mine. The other 51 percent of Dawn is owned by
 Newmont Mining Corporation. Midnite and Newmont jointly oper-
 ate Dawn pursuant to a contract between them. The Commission
 granted the exemption, finding that since the terms of this contract
 provided that Dawn be operated jointly by Midnite and Newmont,
 Dawn was a controlled company of Midnite, even though Midnite
held a minority interest."
    National Rural Utilities Uooperatioe Finance Corporation. ob-
tained from the Commission an order pursuant to Section 6(c) ,
granting a temporary exemption from all provisions of the Invest-
ment Company Act.24 National Rural, a non-profit cooperative asso-
ciation owned and operated by rural electric systems, intends to en-
gage primarily in making loans to its members to finance their rural
electric services and facilities, thereby supplementing the Rural
Electrification Administration ("REA") loan program. To finance
this lending program, National Rural proposes to raise capital by
the sale of membership and capital term certificates to its member
electric systems, and by private placement and underwritten public
offerings of its debentures. The loans to members will be secured by
mortgage liens on the property of borrowing members. Although the

 liens will attach to certain personal property, the primary underly-
 ing security will be the real estate and fixtures of the cooperative
 borrowers.
    A great majority of National Rural's loans will be made jointly
 with the REA, which will control the timing and amount of such
 loans. Once National Rural's loan program is fully implemented, it
 will be primarily engaged in purchasing or acquiring mortgages and
 other liens on and interests in real estate, and thus be excluded from
 the definition of investment company in the Act by reason of Sec-
 tion 3(c) (6) (C). During the initial period of operations, however,
 National Rural may not be able to rely on the Section 3(c) (6) (C)
 exclusion. The Commission's order granted an exemption from the
 Act for this initial period, not to exceed 3 years.
    Talley Industries, Inc. filed an application, pursuant to Section
 17(b) of the Investment Company Act, for an exemption from Sec-
tion 17(a) to permit the merger into Talley of General Time Corpo-
ration. Section 17(a), generally speaking, prohibits an affiliate of an
investment company from purchasing or selling securities or other
property from or to the investment company. Section 17(b) requires
the Commission to exempt a proposed transaction from the provi-
sions of Section 17(a) if evidence establishes that the terms of the
transaction are reasonable and fair, and that the proposed transac-
tion is consistent with the policy of each registered investment com-
pany concerned and with the general purposes of the Act.
   Under the merger plan, the common stockholders of General Time
were to receive one share of a new Talley cumulative preferred,
carrying annual dividends of $1 and convertible into %0 of a share
of Talley common, for each share of General Time, which had been
paying regular dividends. Alternatively they could elect to receive one
share of non-dividend paying Talley common for each such share.
Holders of General Time preferred were to receive four shares of the
new Talley preferred for each of their shares, or could elect to receive
four shares of Talley common for each such share.
   American Investors Fund, Inc., a registered investment company,
owned about 6 percent of Talley's voting stock, making Talley an
affiliated person of the Fund under the Act. At the same time, the
Fund was a shareholder of General Time. The Commission rejected
the contention that since the Fund did not control and was not con-
trolled by the companies being merged, there was no "purchase" or
"sale" involving the Fund within the meaning of Section 17(a). The
Commission held Talley's proposed acquisition of General Time
shares from the Fund a "purchase" and the exchange by Talley of

  its own shares for the General Time shares held by the Fund a
  "sale" within the meaning of Section 17(a) .
     Regarding the substantive terms of the merger, the Commission
  concluded that it could not find the proposal fair to General Time
  shareholders unless they were given a longer-term choice between
  continuing to hold a dividend-paying security with a preferred sta-
  tus or accepting a common stock position in Talley, and that fair-
  ness required that this be accomplished by making the new Talley
  preferred convertible into a full share of Talley common, and by
 eliminating any issuance of Talley common to General Time share-
 holders. The Commission further held that the issuance of four
 shares of new Talley preferred, each convertible into a full share of
 Talley common, for each share of General Time preferred, would
 satisfy fairness standards. The Commission stated that if Talley
 filed an appropriate amendment to its merger plan within 30 days
 incorporating the changes suggested by the Commission, an order
 would be entered granting Talley's application." Talley filed an ap-
 propriate amendment, and its application was granted."
    Ivy Fund, Inc. and its investment adviser, Studley, Shupert &
 Co., Inc. of Boston, filed an application pursuant to Section 17(b) of
 the Investment Company Act for an order exempting from the pro-
 visions of Section 17(a) the grant by the Fund to the adviser of a
 license to use the word "Ivy" in a new name for the adviser and in
the names of other investment companies for which the adviser per-
forms or in the future may perform advisory services."
    The terms of the proposed license, for which the adviser agreed to
pay $2,000, provide that the license is terminable at the option of the
Fund if the adviser ceases to be its investment adviser and that the
right of any other fund to use the name "Ivy" pursuant to the li-
cense is terminable at the option of the Fund in the event the ad-
viser ceases to be an investment adviser to either the Fund or such
other investment company. Following hearings, the hearing exam-
iner overruled the objection of the Commission's staff that the con-
sideration for the license had not been proven reasonable and fair
and concluded that the application met the statutory terms and
should be granted." The Conunission thereafter granted the staff's
petition for review.

 Group applied for an exemption from the provisions of Section
 17(d) of the Act, which prohibits joint transactions between an in-
 vestment company and its affiliates, and Rule 17d-l thereunder, so
 as to enable the Fund and members of The America Group to invest
 in securities of the same issuer.
    The Fund was formed to provide a means for the collective in-
 vestment of funds committed to equity investment by several related
 insurance companies constituting The America Group. Only institu-
 tional members of The America Group may become shareholders of
 the Fund. Since State Mutual will control the Fund, it is an affili-
 ated person of the Fund. Other members of The America Group,
 upon acquisition of 5 percent or more of the voting stock of the
 Fund, would also become affiliated persons of the Fund.
    The Commission granted the exemption requested," with the con-
 dition, to which State Mutual consented, that the investment of
 State Mutual in the Fund will at all times amount to at least 50 per-
 cent of the value of the net assets of the Fund.
    First llIultifnnd of America, I-nc. and First Multifund Advisory
 Corp. filed an application for a declaratory order of the Commission,
 pursuant to Section 554(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act
 ("APA"), that it is lawful, in accordance with Article III, Section
 26 of the Rules of Fair Practice of the NASD, for members of the
NASD who are underwriters of the shares of mutual funds, to grant
 concessions to members of the NASD who act as brokers for pur-
 chasers of such shares not excluding brokers who are affiliated per-
sons of such purchasers. The Fund is an open-end investment com-
pany which invests solely in the shares of other open-end investment
companies. Its co-applicant, the Fund's adviser, had, prior to the
application, placed orders for the Fund for the purchase of shares
of other open-end investment companies, and had retained the deal-
 ers' concessions received from the underwriters of those shares. The
adviser proposed to continue this practice in the future, and the ap-
plication was filed in an effort to secure a Commission determination
that the practice was lawful.
   Section 554(e) of the APA states that "The agency, with like ef-
fect as in the case of other orders, and in its sound discretion may
issue a declaratory order to terminate a controversy or remove un-
certainty." The staff moved to dismiss the application because (1)
the questioned practices had preceded the filing of the application
by almost 2 years and (2) denial of the order would not terminate
the controversy because applicants could then file for exemptions
from the Act.

                       THIRTY-SIXTH      ANNUAL REPORT            149
   The Commission denied the motion to dismiss under the then state
of the proceedings and ordered a hearing on the application to con-
sider, in addition to the issues raised by applicants, certain issues
raised by the staff as to the propriety under the Act of applicants'
practices." Included in the specified issues were whether the Com-
mission has the power to issue the declaratory order requested and,
if so, whether it should do so, and whether the adviser's practices
were prohibited by Sections 17(a) (1), 17(e) (1) and/or 22(d) of the
Act, unless exempted. Hearings were held, and at the close of the
fiscal year, the matter was pending.
   In N.Ll.S.D. v, S.E.O., the Commission's order granting First Na-
tional City Bank of New York exemptions from certain provisions
of the Investment Company Act with respect. to a Commingled In-
vestment Account which the Bank established and registered under
the Act was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit," In the same opinion, the court reversed the
judgment of the district court in Investment Oompany Institute v.
Camp, which had invalidated Regulations of the Comptroller of the
Currency relied on by the Bank in establishing its Commingled Ac-
count. Petitions for certiorari filed by the NASD and the I.C.I. have
been granted by the Supreme Court. The brief filed by the Solicitor
General in the NASD case states that he has been advised by the
Commission that only two of the present members of the Commis-
sion participated in the Commission decision (one supporting the de-
cision and one dissenting) and that the three subsequently-appointed
members were not prepared to take any position, and that accord-
ingly the Commission expressed no position on the merits. The
Solicitor General, as an amicus curiae, urged affirmance.
                    CONTROL OF IMPROPER          PRACTICES
Inspection and Investigation Program
   During the fiscal year, the Commission's staff conducted 69 inspec-
tions pursuant to Section 31(b) of the Investment Company Act.
Many of these inspections disclosed violations of that Act and of
other statutes administered by the Commission. Among the viola-
tions were inadequate arrangements for safekeeping of the invest-
ment company's portfolio securities, inadequate disclosures concern-
ing the activities of the company, failure to maintain adequate
fidelity bond coverage for persons dealing with investment company
assets and self-dealing transactions which included arrangements by

 affiliates of investment companies to recapture fund brokerage for
 their own benefit,
   As in past years there have been a number of serious accounting
and bookkeeping problems. Some companies have priced shares inac-
curately because their books did not enable them to compute net
asset value correctly. As a result of various operational problems,
several companies voluntarily suspended sales of shares pending the
resolution of these problems,
   In light of the increasing number of registered investment compa-
nies, the Commission determined to expand the inspection program
carried on by its staff. Separate units for inspecting and investigat-
ing investment companies are being established in the Boston, Chi-
cago and San Francisco regional offices.New York had previously
established such a unit. The other regional officesare being required
to allocate a greater portion of their manpower and resources to this
program.
   Largely as an outgrowth of information obtained during inspec-
tions, 12 private investigations were commenced during the fiscal
year to develop facts concerning what appeared to be serious viola-
tions. As a result of the Commission's inspection and investigation
program, approximately $1.3 million was returned to investors ei-
ther directly or indirectly during the year. This brings to about $8.1
million the sums returned to investors since the inception of the
inspection program in 1963.
Civil and Administrative Proceedings
   During the fiscal year, the Commission instituted a number of
civil and administrative proceedings involving investment companies
and continued prosecution of other investment company proceedings.
   Failure to Register as an Investment Company.-The Commission
brought an injunctive action in February 1970 in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York against First
N ational Oity Bank ("Citibank"), AIerl'ill Lynch, Pierce, F enmer
and 81nith, Inc. and Special Investment Advis01'y Service
("SIA.8")     The complaint alleged that the defendants had violated
             .3~


Section 7 (b) of the Investment Company Act by operating an unreg-
istered investment company and Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Se-
curities Act by offering and selling unregistered securities issued by
SIAS. It was alleged, among other things, that Citibank and Merrill
Lynch had organized SIAS as an unincorporated fund which had
been primarily engaged since at least October 1, 1964,in the business
of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities;
that SIAS had a value of approximately $35 million and over 1,000

  security holders; and that, while investments in SIAS were solicited
  on the representation that each investor's investment would receive
  personalized or individual attention, moneys received were in fact
  invested in a virtually identical manner in one of two gronps of se-
  curities.
     While the defendants denied that they had engaged in any illegal
 or improper conduct, they entered into a Stipulation and Undertak-
 ing with the Commission, pursuant to which the court entered an
 order disposing of the action but retained jurisdiction to ensure ful-
 fillment of the terms of the Stipulation and Undertaking." These re-
 quire that defendants cease the offer, sale, or redemption of securi-
 ties issued by SIAS and the purchase or sale of securities for the
 account of SIAS and refrain in the future from engaging in activi-
 ties similar to those described in the complaint except in compliance
 with the registration requirements of the Securities Act and the In-
 vestment Company Act. Mer-rill Lynch also agreed to terminate its
 relationships with other banks and persons which offered sen-ices
 similar to SIAS.
    Prospectuses; Sales Literature.-In .Ianuary 1!:l70,the Commission
 filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the South-
 ern District of New York seeking an injunction against American
Goneral Lnsuranoe OO'lnpany and certain affiliated companies, Chan-
ning Financial Corporation, Channing Company, Incorporated, and
 The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company (VALIC).34 The
complaint alleged that commencing on September 3, 196!:l,and on
each succeeding 'Vednesday through October 2$), 19G!:l,the defend-
ants caused advertisements to be placed in the 'Vall Street Journal
offering for sale shares issued by the Channing group of investment
companies and variable annuity contracts issued by VALIC separate
accounts: that these ad vertisements failed to comply with the pros-
pectus requirements of Section 5 (b) (1) of the Securities Act; and
that the defendants failed to file copies of the advertisements with
the Commission as required by Section 24:(b) of the Investment
Company Act. The case was subsequently transferred to the United
State District Court for the Southern District of Texas."
   Norman F. Dacey ill Associates, IIlC., a registered broker-dealer,
and its president, N orman. F. Dacey, were censured for securities
violations in connection with their offering of shares of Dacey Trust

 in a hearing examiner's initial decision which became the final deci-
 sion of the Commission when no appeal was filed. According to the
 decision, after the Fund had filed a Securities Act registration state-
 ment, respondents prepared and used a form letter to answer inquir-
 ies concerning the prospective offering. It was found that these let-
 ters constituted the first step of an effort to sell Fund shares and, as
 such, were "prospectuses." They did not, however, contain the infor-
 mation required to be included in a prospectus and were not accom-
panied or preceded by a prospectus meeting such requirements.
 Their use therefore violated Section 5(b) of the Securities Act.
Moreover, the letters contained "materially misleading" statements
in that among other things they implied an assurance that an inves-
tor's capital would increase but did not point out the market risks
inherently involved in an investment in Fund shares.
    Portfolio Transactions and Restricted Securities.-During         the
fiscal year, the Commission instituted administrative proceedings in-
volving Winfield Growth Fund, Lnc., a registered open-end invest-
ment company, certain broker-dealer and investment adviser firms
and individuals affiliated with the Fund, and others." The orders
for proceedings alleged, among other things, that respondents en-
gaged in acts and practices designed to channel fund brokerage to or
for the benefit of affiliated persons of the Fund and that certain re-
spondents caused the Fund to purchase and value restricted securi-
ties improperly. The orders alleged that these activities violated
various provisions of the Federal securities laws, including the self-
dealing, pricing and redemption provisions of the Investment Com-
pany Act and antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and Se-
curities Exchange Act. The Fund, without admitting or denying
the facts alleged, consented to findings that its registration statement
was deficient in that, among other things, it failed to disclose the
above practices, and to the entry of a stop order. Thereafter it
amended its registration statement which, as amended, was declared
effective." Following the close of the fiscal year, offers of settlement
submitted by the remaining respondents and providing for various
sanctions were accepted by the Commission." The Commission's de-
finitive findings and opinion are to be issued at a later date.
   Proceedings also involving alleged misuse of fund brokerage were
instituted against Provident Management Oorporation, investment

  adviser to and principal underwriter for Provident Fund for In-
  come, Inc.; Porteous & Company, Inc., a broker-dealer under com-
 mon control with Management ; and certain other broker-dealers and
  individuals. The allegations in the order for proceedings related
  principally to the receipt of compensation by Porteous & Co. in the
  form of clearance commissions directed to Porteous & Co. by certain
 broker-dealers who were selected by the respondents affiliated with
 the Fund to execute portfolio transactions for the Fund; the receipt
 of tender fees by Porteous & Co. in connection with the tender of
 Fund portfolio securities for which Porteous & Co. performed no
 services; and the failure to disclose the receipt of such monies by
 Porteous & Co. in the Fund's prospectus, proxy material and other
 materials filed with the Commission.
    Offers of settlement were submitted by the respondents, including
 the unaffiliated broker-dealers who allegedly participated in the im-
 proper arrangements with respect to portfolio brokerage, and were
 accepted by the Commission." The offers provided for the imposi-
 tion of various sanctions and the findings of certain alleged viola-
 tions, which were, however, not admitted. Detailed findings and an
 opinion were issued by the Commission following the close of the
 fiscal year.?
    In June 1970, the Commission filed a complaint in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York for a
preliminary and final injunction against Arnold Bernhard &; 00.,
Ino., a registered investment adviser, and certain affiliated firms and
individuals." Bernhard & Co. publishes investment advisory publi-
cations under the name "Value Line" and acts as investment adviser
for several investment companies bearing that name.
    The complaint alleges, among other things, violations by the de-
fendants of the antifraud provisions of the securities acts arising out
of the failure to disclose Bernhard & CO.'s activities as a finder of
mergers, acquisitions, and financing in that firm's publications and
in investment company prospectuses; of Sections 17(e) (1) and
15(a) (1) of the Investment Company Act by virtue of the accept-
ance of compensation for placement of investment company portfo-
lio transactions; and of Sections 20 (a) and 34(b) of the Investment

  40 Securities  Exchange Act Release Nos. 8790 (December 31, 1969), 8822
(February 19, 1970) and 8846 (March 27, 1970). An order suspending the
effectiveness of the Fund's registration statement because of nondisclosure re-
garding the matters described above had been issued during the prior fiscal
year and had been vacated following the filing of a corrective amendment. See
35th Annual Report, p. 138.

Company Act and Rule 20a-1 thereunder in that proxy materials
and an annual report of one of the investment companies filed with
the Commission contained untrue statements and omitted material in-
formation regarding the above matters.
   During the fiscal year, the Commission filed a brief objecting to a
proposed settlement in Eurach. v, Weissman, private litigation in-
volving Dreyfus Fund, Inc." In essence, the settlement provided
that the Fund's advisory fee would be offset by certain net profits
derived from brokerage activities of a subsidiary of the Fnnd's in-
vestment adviser and it guaranteed a minimum benefit to the Fund
from this arrangement. "Net profits" was defined to include commis-
sions received by the subsidiary in "reciprocal" transactions.
   The Commission argued that the settlement was illusory because it
did not provide Fund shareholders with any benefits they were not
in any event entitled to receive. The Commission contended that an
investment adviser to a fund is under an obligation, in executing
portfolio transactions, not to ignore available means to enable the
fund to achieve the most favorable result nnder the circumstances.
The Commission also urged that Section 17(e) (1) of the Investment
Company Act precluded the subsidiary from receiving and retaining
reciprocal commissions where it did not perform an actual brokerage
function. After the Commission filed its brief, the parties to the ac-
tion amended the proposed settlement so that the subsidiary's net
proceeds from reciprocal business would be credited to the Fund
without deductions except for expenses directly related to such re-
ceipts and would not be applied in reduction of the minimum recov-
ery guaranteed to the Fund by its adviser under the settlement.
   In March 1970, the court, noting that the amendment to the pro-
posed settlement obviated some of the Commission's objections,
approved the settlement. The court reasoned that in view of the
"brokerage" exception of Section 17(e) and the absence of other rel-
evant authority, it wold not be justified in holding that the subsidi-
ary was obligated to turn over all of its brokerage profits to the
Fund."
    Gross Abuse of Trust.- In January 1970,the United States District
Court for the District of Nevada entered a decree which among
other things permanantly enjoined Peter .A.. Strajaoe from further
acts constituting a gross abuse of trust with respect to Kent Growth
Fund, which the complaint alleged is nnder his control, and from
converting to his own use, or the use of another, any assets of the

  Fund." The decree also enjoined Straface, the Fund, Bonanza Invest-
 ment Management Company (the Fund's investment adviser), and
 National Capital Corporation, which are also allegedly controlled by
 Straface, from making false statements and omitting material infor-
 mation concerning the operations, financial condition, personnel and
 facilities of and capital contributions to the three companies and
 failing to comply with the record-keeping, reporting and minimum
 capital requirements of the Investment Company Act. The defend-
 ants consented to the decree.
     Back Office Prohlems.-Two       proceedings involved failure by
 mutual funds, and investment advisers and managers of mutual funds,
 to maintain on a current basis the books, accounts and other records
 of the mutual funds as required by Section 31(a) of the Investment
 Company Act and Rule 31a-1 thereunder.
    In January 1970, the Commission filed a complaint in the U.S.
 District Court for the Central District of California seeking to en-
 join Enterprise Fund, Inc. ("Enterprise"), an open-end diversified
 management investment company, and Shareholders Management
 Company ("Management"), Enterprise's investment adviser and
 principal underwriter, from further violations of certain "bookkeep-
 ing" requirements under Section 31(a) and Rule 3la-l,46 The com-
plaint alleged that Enterprise, aided and abetted by Management,
had failed to maintain and keep current required books and records
and requested the court to enjoin the offer or sale of Enterprise
shares until that situation had been remedied.
   On February 27, 1970, the court entered a final judgment of per-
manent injunction against Enterprise and an order approving a
stipulation and undertaking with respect to Management, which
prohibit the offer or sale of Enterprise shares until further court
order and direct Enterprise to make and keep current its accounts,
books and other records in compliance with Section 31(a) and Rule
31a-1 thereunder. The order also requires Management to make cur-
rent and accurate those accounts, books and records of Enterprise
kept by it and to use its best efforts to insure compliance by Enter-
prise with Section 31(a) and Rule 31a-L Enterprise and Manage-
ment consented to the entry of the permanent injunction and order
without admitting the violations charged in the complaint.
   Pursuant to the stipulation and undertaking, Management, at
its own expense, must retain an independent certified public account-
ing firm to review the accounts, books and other records of Enter-
prise and to comment on any material inadequacies found to exist in

 the accounting system or the internal accounting controls and proce-
 dures. The report of the accounting firm is a condition precedent to
 an application by Enterprise to the court for permission to resume
 sales of its securities. In addition the accounting firm is to examine
 Enterprise's capital accounts including control, subsidiary and indi-
 vidual shareholder accounts, and to render a report as to whether
 these accounts are in compliance with Section 31(a).
    The stipulation and undertaking also provides that, prior to ap-
 plication for resumption of sales, Management is to conduct or have
 conducted, at its own expense, an analysis of the costs and expenses
 incurred or paid by Enterprise and Management in connection with
 the maintenance of Enterprise's accounts, books and other records, re-
 port thereon to Enterprise and the Commission, and pay Enterprise
 for such costs and expenses incurred by Enterprise as shall be agreed
 upon between Enterprise and Management and approved by the
 court. At fiscal year end, the accountant's report and the cost and
 expense analysis had not been completed.
   In August 1969, the Commission instituted administrative pro-
 ceedings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 against Value
 Line Securities, Ino., a registered broker-dealer which acts as princi-
 pal distributor for three registered investment companies, the firm's
president and the controlling shareholder of the firm's parent which
 acts as manager of and investment adviser to the three companies.
   The order for proceedings alleged that the respondents offered
and sold shares of the three investment companies by means of mis-
leading prospectuses which failed to disclose a lack of personnel and
facilities necessary to service shareholders' accounts properly. It fur-
ther alleged, among other things, that respondents violated Section
31 of the Investment Company Act by not properly maintaining the
books and records of Value Line Special Situations Fund, Inc. dur-
ing the period April to December 1968, and that they filed mislead-
ing affidavits with the Commission."
   Improper Accounting Methods.- The Commission instituted
proceedings under Section 8(d) of the Securities Act of 1933 to de-
termine whether a stop order should be issued against a registration
statement filed by Monmouth Oapital Corporation; a small business
investment company registered under the Investment Company Act.
The proceedings were instituted on the basis of allegations by the
staff that Monmouth had made a series of stock distributions with-
out adequate undistributed earned surplus to capitalize such distribu-
tions as required by proper accounting principles. The staff also al-
leged that Monmouth's failure to follow generally accepted
 47   See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 8670 (August 21,1969).
                  TF.URTY-SLKTH   ANNUAL   REPORT                157
accounting principles in the preparation of its financial statements
rendered the financial statements misleading.
   Monmouth submitted an offer of settlement in which it consented to
Commission findings that generally accepted accounting principles
were not followed with respect to the various stock distributions
since it did not have the requisite earned surplus. It further con-
sented to a finding that its registration statement omitted to state
material facts required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, in that the accountants' opinion
with respect to the financial statements contained therein did not
note that such statements were not prepared in accordance with gen-
erally accepted accounting principles. The offer of settlement was
conditioned upon the Commission dismissing the proceeding without
the entry of a stop order. Monmouth agreed to amend its registra-
tion statement so as to correct the deficiencies within 90 days after
acceptance of the offer by the Commission. The Commission deter-
mined that acceptance of Monmouth's offer would satisfactorily re-
solve the proceedings. Commission findings and an opinion dealing
with the improper practices and the misleading aspects of the finan-
cial statements were to be issued after the amendment had been filed.
                                 PART VI
  REGULATION         OF PUBLIC.UTILITY          HOLDING COMPANIES
   Under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the
 Commission regulates interstate public-utility holding-company sys-
tems engaged in the electric utility business and/or in the retail dis-
tribution of gas. The Commission's jurisdiction also extends to natu-
ral gas pipeline companies and other nonutility companies which are
subsidiary companies of registered holding companies. There are
three principal areas of regulation under the Act. The first includes
those provisions of the Act which require the physical integration of
public-utility companies and functionally related properties of hold-
ing-company systems and the simplification of intercorporate rela-
tionships and financial structures of such systems. The second covers
the financing operations of registered holding companies and their
subsidiary companies, the acquisition and disposition of securities
and properties, and certain accounting practices, servicing arrange-
ments, and intercompany transactions. The third area of regulation
includes the exemptive provisions of the Act, provisions relating to
the status under the Act of persons and companies, and provisions
regulating the right of persons affiliated with a public-utility com-
pany to become affiliated with a second such company through the
acquisition of securities.'
    COMPOSITION OF REGISTERED HOLDING-COMPANY SYSTEMS
   At the close of the 1970 fiscal year, there were 23 holding compa-
nies registered under the Act. Of these, 20 are included in the 17 "ac-
tive" registered holding-company systems, 3 of the 20 being subhold-
ing utility operating companies in these systems." The remaining 3
registered holding companies, which are relatively small, are not
considered part of "active" systems," In the 17 active systems, there
  1 Pending legislation to transfer to the Federal Power Commission the Com-
mission's functions under the Holding Company Act is discussed at pages 20-21,

   2 The three subholding companies are The Potomac Edison Company and

:\Ionongahela Power Company, public-utility subsidiary companies of Allegheny
Power System, Inc., and Southwestern Electric Power Company, a public-util-
ity subsidiary company of Central and South West Corporation.
   3 These holding companies are British American Utilities Corporation; Kin-
zua Oil & Gas Corporation and its subholding company, Northwestern Pennsyl-
vania Gas Corporation; and Standard Gas & Electric Company, which is in
the process of dissolution.

SECTION    II MATTERS      IN REGISTERED       HOLDING-COMPANY          SYSTEMS
   W(Ulhington G(UILight Oompany, which was granted, pursuant to
Section 3(a) (2), an exemption from the Act except Sections
 11(b) (2), 11(d) , and 11(e) , has filed a plan under Section 11(e) 4 pro-
posing the elimination of the 0.7 percent publicly-held minority in-
terest in the common stock of its gas utility subsidiary company,
Shenandoah Gas Company." A hearing on the plan was held after
the close of the fiscal year, and the case is pending for decision by
the Commission.
   As reported previously," the Commission approved, as fair and eq-
uitable under Section 11(e) of the Act, a plan of liquidation and
dissolution of Standard G(UI and Electric Oompany, a registered
holding company. The plan was approved and enforced by the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware, which overruled
objections by the State of New York that under its abandoned prop-
erty law it was entitled to receive funds due unlocated New York
stockholders. In a decision rendered on September 25, 1970, the
Court of Appeals affirmed.'
     PROCEEDINGS    WITH RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS,                  SALES, AND
                          OTHER MATTERS
   In American Electric Power Oompany, Inc., discussed previously,"
hearings were reopened at the instance of the company on its appli-
cation to acquire, pursuant to an invitation for tenders, shares of
common stock of Cohunbus and Southern Ohio Electric Company, a
nonassociate electric utility company, in exchange for AEP stock, on
the basis of 1.3 shares of AEP common stock for each share of Co-
lumbus common stock. The Commission's Division of Corporate
Regulation opposes approval of the application, contending that the
proposed acquisition would have serious anti-competitive effects and
tend towards a concentration of control of a kind and to an extent
detrimental to the public interest, in contravention of Section
10(b) (1) of the Act. The United States Department of Justice has
also announced its opposition to approval of the proposed acquisi-
tion.

ing continued during the fiscal year on the proposal for an affiliation,

  tric System and Eastern Utilities Associates, both registered holding
  companies, and Boston Edison Company, a nonaffiliated electric utility
  company.
     In lJfiohigan Oonsolidated Gas Oompany/o the Commission denied
  an application by Michigan Consolidated, a retail natural gas com-
  pany and a subsidiary company of American Natural Gas Company,
  a registered holding company, for permission to provide financing to
  a subsidiary company which, pursuant to the National Housing Act,
  proposed to construct in its service area two housing projects for
 low and moderate income families. In a majority decision, in which
 the Chairman and Commissioners Herlong and Needham joined and
 which overruled an earlier Commission decision permitting an ini-
 tial housing project,l1 the Commission held that the acquisition
 would not meet the standards of Sections 10(c) (1) and 11(b) (1) and
 ordered Michigan Consolidated to divest its interest in the two hous-
 ing projects forthwith. Section 10(c) (1) bars approval of an acquisi-
 tion detrimental to Section 11, and Section 11(b) (1) provides,
 among other things, that the Commission may permit retention of
 nonutility businesses which are "reasonably incidental, or economi-
 cally necessary or appropriate to the operations" of an integrated
 public-utility system. The majority, noting that the proposed hous-
ing ventures were related to the operations of the public-utility sys-
 tem "only in that [they] may be held to rehabilitate and preserve
 areas serviced by Michigan Consolidated and thereby promote its
general gas utility business," concluded that such a "customer rela-
tionship" is not "the type of operating or functional relationship
which Congress contemplated when it established the standards of
the 'other business' clauses." Nor, found the majority, was the under-
taking "in the ordinary course of business" so as to warrant an ex-
emption under Section 9(c) (3).12
    In a separate opinion, Commissioner Owens concurred in part and
dissented in part. He agreed with the majority that the application
could not be granted under the standards of Section 11(b) (1), but he
would have granted the application pursuant to Section 9(c) (3) on the
ground that the acquisition by Michigan Consolidated of the securities
of its housing subsidiary was to be "in the ordinary course of business"
of Michigan Consolidated and was not detrimental to the public inter-
est or the interest of investors or consumers. Commissioner Smith, in

   Subsequently, Michigan Consolidated and the subsidiary filed a
motion for an interim order authorizing them to complete the con-
struction and financing of the two projects, as a step in implement-
ing the divestiture order. This motion was denied (Commissioner
Smith dissenting}." Thereafter the subsidiary filed a further motion
seeking authority to issue and sell a mortgage note :for about
$:2,166,000on one of the projects, the proceeds to be used to operate
that project and pay contractors' bills for the other project during
the period required to implement the divestiture order. The Commis-
sion (Commissioner Smith dissenting) denied this motion as well.>
   On August 20, 1970, a bill to amend the Holding Company Act to
enable holding company systems to participate in governmentally as-
sisted low and moderate income housing programs was introduced in
the Senate." The amendment, which would add paragraph (4) to
Section 9 (c) of the Act, would empower the Commission, by rule,
regulation, or order, to exempt from the acquisition provisions of
Section 10 of the Act (1) the securities of a subsidiary company en-
gaged in the business of providing low and moderate income hous-
ing within its service area and pursuant to housing programs au-
thorized by the National Housing Act, as amended, or a substitute
thereof, or (2) the securities of a company organized for such hous-
ing programs within its service area which receives assistance from
a company created or organized pursuant to Title IX of the Hous-
ing and Urban Development Act of 1968. In a letter of August 31,
1970, to the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking and
Currency, to which the amendment was referred, Chairman Budge
stated that the Commission would have no objection to enactment of
the bill.

  to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Hilo
  Electric Company. Although the electric utility companies operate
  exclusively on different islands of the State of Hawaii and Section
 2(a) (29) (A) requires that an integrated electric-utility system be ei-
 ther physically interconnected or capable of physical interconnec-
 tion, the Commission decided that "in assessing the practicalities of
 economic and physical integration in this case, [it should] give par-
 ticular weight to the unique geography of the State of Hawaii in
 light of the legislative history." 18
     Illinois Pourer Oompany 19 involved an application by Illinois
 Power, an exempt holding company, for approval of an acquisition,
 pursuant to an invitation of tenders, of the common stock of Central
 Illinois Public Service Company, also an exempt holding company.
 Both companies are engaged in the electric and gas utility business
 within the State of Illinois. The Commission approved the proposed
 acquisition and continuation of the existing exemption of Illi-
nois Power under Section 3(a) (1) of the Act but on condition that
 the gas properties of both companies be divested. In imposing this
condition the Commission stressed the Supreme Court's emphasis, in
S.E.O. v, N e10 England Electric System,/o on the policy of the Act
favoring competition between electric and gas companies. The Com-
mission denied the request by certain preferred stockholders of Cen-
tral Illinois to require, as a condition of the acquisition, that the
several series of outstanding preferred stock of Central Illinois be
eliminated through redemption, exchange for Illinois Power stock,
or otherwise. Illinois Power subsequently announced that it did not
intend to make the tender offer because it could not accept the condi-
tion imposed by the Commission. Prior to this announcement the
preferred stockholders of Central Illinois petitioned for review of
the order insofar as it denied the condition they sought."
    In Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corporation. and lUaine Yan-

that the terms of such proposals resolved the issues previously raised
under Section 10(b) (1). Orders of the Commission approving the
original applications 24 had been reversed by the Court of Appeals 25
because of certain antitrust issues under Section 10(b) (1) of the
Act, and the cases had been remanded to the Commission."
   In OMo Power Oompany,27 the Commission approved the acquisi-
tion by Ohio Power, a subsidiary company of American Electric
Power Company, Inc., of the municipal electric utility system owned
and operated by the City of Martins Ferry, Ohio, for a cash consid-
eration of $4,825,000. The Commission determined among other
things that under the circumstances, including the deteriorated con-
dition of the Martins Ferry facilities, the proposed acquisition did
not have anticompetitive effects requiring disapproval under Section
10(b)(1).
   As previously reported, Middle South Utilities, Inc., a registered
holding company, has filed an application relating to a proposed offer
to acquire, through an invitation for tenders, the outstanding shares
of common stock of Arkansas-Missouri Power Company, a nonasso-

common stock." A hearing has been held, and the matter is now pend-
ing for determination by the Commission.

 an application relating to a proposal under which, in effect, each share
of National Gas & Oil Corporation, a nonassociate gas utility com-

hearing has been ordered to determine whether the proposed acquisi-
tion meets the standards of Section 10 of the Act.29

 Recent Financing Developments
    The financing highlight of fiscal 1970 was the record volume of
 external financing by registered holding companies and their subsid-
 iaries. The $1,684 million of new securities issued and sold for cash
 by these companies, as shown in the preceding table, represents the
 greatest volume of external financing by companies subject to the
 Act for any year since passage of the Act, except for fiscal 1946
 when approximately $2,158 million of securities were issued and
 sold. Among other things, the $299.4million of common stock issued
 and sold to the public and existing shareholders in fiscal 1970 repre-
 sented the greatest amount of common equity financing since fiscal
 1946.33 This unprecedented volume of financing was accompanied by
record-high interest and preferred dividend rates, and the combina-
tion of these factors induced a number of departures from conven-
tional financing methods during fiscal 1970.
   For many years, the first mortgage bonds issued and sold by elec-
tric utility companies subject to the Act have uniformly carried
30-year maturities. Commencing in the last month of fiscal 1969,
variations began to appear. On June 18, 1969, Indiana & Michigan
Electric Company, an electric utility subsidiary of American Elec-
tric Power Company, Inc., a registered holding company, issued and
sold, pursuant to competitive bidding, $60 million principal amount
of first mortgage bonds having a 5-year maturity and a cost of
money to the company of 7.95 percent.s- In November 1969, Ohio
Power Company, another electric utility subsidiary of American
Electric Power Company, Inc., issued and sold, pursuant to competi-

   33 This very large increase in volume of new capital financing by companies

subject to the Act occurred although during the 24-year period (1946-1970)
the number of electric and /?:asutility companies subject to the Act underwent
major coutraction clue to the integration and simplification requirements of
 Section l1(b) of the Act. As of June 30, 1946, there were 49 registered holding-
company systems which included 103 holding companies, 367 electric and/or
gas utility subsidiary companies, and 428 nonutility and inactive companies,
maldug a total of 898 companies subject to the Act. See 12th Annual Report,
p. 48. As of June 30, 1970, there were only 17 active regtstered hnlding-eom-
pany systems, and they comprised 20 registered holding companies, 94 electric
and/or gas utility subxidiary companies, and 64 nonutility and inactive compa-
nies, making a total of 178 companies. See page 159, supra, for the tabulation
of companies as of June 30, 1970.

maturity having a range of from 5 to 30 years, the maturity date to be deter-

     On March 25, 1970, Indiana & Michigan Electric Company was
 authorized to issue and sell $50 million principal amount of first
 mortgage bonds due 2000 and $15 million principal amount of first
 mortgage bonds due 1975. Separate bids for each series of bonds
 were invited, and both issues were sold on April 7, 1970.36 The is-
 suer's interest costs were approximately 8.315 percent on the 5-year
 series and 8.872percent on the 30-year series. On April 24, 1970,Ap-
 palachian Power Company, another subsidiary company of Ameri-
 can Electric Power Company, Inc., was authorized to issue and
 sell at competitive bidding $70 million principal amount of
first mortgage bonds with a maturity of 25 years." 'Yhen this
issue was not sold, the company was authorized by supplemental
order to issue and sell the bonds in one or two series, the principal
amount and maturity (not less than 5 years nor more than ;30years)
 of each such series to be determined by the issuer not Jess than. 72
hours prior to the opening of bids." On .Iune 15, 1970,the company
issued and sold $20 million principal amount of bonds with a 25-
year maturity and $50 million of bonds with a 5-year maturity. The
company's interest costs were approximately 9.192 percent on the
5-year series and 10.114percent on the 25-year series.
    Similarly, on March 20, 1970, The Narragansett Electric Com-
pany, an electric utility subsidiary of New England Electric System,
a registered holding company, was authorized to issue and sell at
competitive bidding $7,500,000principal amount of first mortgage
bonds with a maturity of not less than 5 years nor more than 30

April 1, 1970, at an interest cost to the company of 8.367 percent."

 not permitted to issue long-term debt securities, except under extra-
 ordinary circumstances. However, during the fiscal year, General
 Public Utilities Corporation, a registered holding company whose
 subsidiaries normally are financed in this manner, was authorized to
 issue and sell at competitive bidding $50 million principal amount
 of 5-year debentures, and to issue and sell, from time to time but not
 later than December 31, 1972, commercial paper notes having an ag-
 gregate principal amount outstanding at any time not in excess of
 $100 million. The company was authorized to borrow from commer-
 cial banks, not later than December 31, 1972, in an aggregate princi-
 pal amount outstanding at any time not in excess of $85 million, for
 the purpose of meeting such maturities of the commercial paper
 notes as might not be refunded by the issuance of additional com-
 mercial paper notes. In addition, the company was authorized to
borrow an additional $50 million from banks not later than Decem-
ber 31, 1972. The net proceeds of the debentures, commercial paper,
and bank borrowings were to be used by General Public Utilities
Corporation to make additional investments in its public-utility sub-
sidiary companies to finance their construction."
   The sharp rise of interest rates in recent years has made it in-
creasingly difficult for registered holding-company systems to main-
tain earnings coverage of interest requirements on their long-term
debt securities at sufficient levels to satisfy indenture requirements
and avoid impairment of the ratings of their debt securities by the
investment advisory services. One consequence of this development
has been increasing resort to preferred stock financing. In fiscal
1970, as shown in the table above, registered holding-company sys-
tems issued and sold 10 issues of preferred stock with an aggregate
value of $101.6 million, which, except for one year, was the largest
volume of this type of financing since 1947.
Competitive Bidding
   Rule 50 under the Act requires that all proposed issuances or sales
of any securities of, or owned by, any company in a registered hold-
ing-company system be sold at competitive bidding unless an excep-
tion from such requirement is available under the terms of para-
graphs (a) (1) to (a) (5), inclusive, of the rule. Of the 59 issues of
new securities shown in the preceding table, 56 issues, aggregating
$1,554 million, were offered for competitive bidding pursuant to the
requirement of Rule 50. The remaining three issues were common
stocks totaling $130 million, which were sold at prices and terms de-
termined by the issuers or set by negotiation with investment bank-

the competitive bidding requirement.
   One of these issues was a negotiated underwritten public offering
of 2,540,097shares of additional common stock by American Electric
Power Company, Inc., a registered holding company, with aggregate
value of $76.8 million, which was offered on August 18, 1969 at the
closing market price on the New York Stock Exchange of $30.25per
share. Underwriters' compensation of $0.90 per share was equivalent
to 2.975 percent of the public offering price,'! The two other issues
which were not sold pursuant to competitive bidding were nonunder-
written rights offerings of common stock to its shareholders by Gen-
eral Public Utilities Corporation, a registered holding company. The
first of these two issues was an offering of 1,340,000shares, in Sep-
tember-October 1969, at a subscription price of $21.50 per share,
which represented a discount of 10.4 percent from the market price
of $24.00 per share. Participating dealers were employed to solicit
subscriptions by shareholders through exercise of their rights and to
sell any stock not so subscribed. A total of 1,322,500shares were sold
through exercise of rights and sales by participating dealers, who
received average compensation on all shares sold of $0.20 per share,
or 0.93 percent of the subscription price. The remaining 17,500
shares were withdrawn."
   The second rights offering by General Public Utilities Corpora-
tion, in the amount of 1,405,000shares, was initially authorized by
the Commission as an underwritten rights offering with the sub-
scription price to be determined by the issuer and underwriters'
compensation to be determined by competitive bidding pursuant to
the terms of Rule 50Y On May 14, 1970, the Commission authorized
the company to make the proposed rights offering without standby
underwriting and to employ participating dealers to solicit subscrip-
tions by the company's shareholders and sell the unsubscribed
shares.w The offering was made in May-June 1970, at a subscrip-
tion price of $17.50 per share, which represented a discount of 14.1
percent from the market price of $20.375 per share. Shareholders
were accorded oversubscription privileges, and all shares were sub-
scribed by them. Participating dealers received average compensa-

    In both rights offerings by General Public Utilities Corporation,
 the sales of stock to stockholders through exercise of rights were au-
 tomatically excepted from the competitive bidding requirement of
 Rule 50 by the terms of paragraph (a) (1) thereof, and the sales of
 unsubscribed shares through participating dealers were excepted
 from competitive bidding by the Commission pursuant to the provi-
 sions of paragraph (a) (5) of the rule.
    Two other issues shown in the preceding table received only one
 bid each when offered for competitive bidding, and the Commission
 granted exceptions from the competitive bidding requirement so as
 to permit immediate acceptance of such bids. One of these was an
offering of $50 million principal amount of 10-% percent debentures
 due 1974:of General Public Utilities Corporation," and the other
was an offering of 50,000 shares of $9.40 cumulative preferred stock
of The Potomac Edison Company, an electric utility subsidiary com-
pany of Allegheny Power System, Inc., a registered holding
company."
   In fiscal 1969 the Commission approved a plan of reorganization
under Section 11(e) of the Act, pursuant to which Pennzoil Com-
pany, then a registered holding company, and its gas utility subsidi-
ary company, United Gas Corporation, were consolidated to form
Pennzoil United, Inc., subject to a condition that Pennzoil United
dispose of its interest in all of its gas utility properties." Subse-
quently, the gas properties were transferred to United Gas, Inc., a
new subsidiary company of Pennzoil United, which was authorized
to invite bids for stand-by compensation on a proposed underwritten
rights offering of United Gas common stock to the stockholders of
Pennzoil United." Following the failure to receive any bids for the
United Gas stock, the proposed rights offering was excepted from
the competitive bidding requirement of Rule 50 under the terms of
paragraph (a) (5) thereof, and Pennzoil United attempted to negoti-
ate an underwritten rights offering." This attempt also was unsuc-

    Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corporation applied for an ex-

    On September 17, 1D70, the Commission announced that no excep-
tions from the requirements of competiti ve bidding will be granted
informally so as to permit negotiations with investment bankers for
the purpose of either choosing a pnrticular group of bankers to be
the underwriters or to establish the terms and conditions under
which the securities arc to be sold. All such matters will be consid-
ered only by way of a formal application ill accordance with the
requirements of subparagraph (a) (5) of Rule 50.54
   During the period from May 7, W11, the effective date of Rule 50,
to June 30, 1970, a total of 1,109 issues with an aggregate value of

to $5 million each, 3 debt issues were in excess of $100 million each,"

Policy as to Refundahility of Preferred Stock
   During the fiscal year certain registered holding-company systems
 and other interested persons requested a modification of those provi-
sions of the Commission's Statement of Policy Regarding Preferred
Stock Subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935
which required that preferred stocks issued and sold pursuant to the
terms of Sections 6(b) and 7 of the Act be redeemable at the option
of the issuer "at any time upon reasonable notice and with reasona-
ble redemption premiums, if any." 56 On April 20, 1970,the Commis-
sion published an invitation for comments." On June 22, 1970, the
Commission adopted certain modifications of its Statement of Policy
which permit the issuers of preferred stocks subject to the Act to in-
 clude in the charters, by-laws, or related instruments defining the
rights, preferences, and privileges of new issues of preferred stock, a
provision prohibiting for a period of not more than 5 years the re-
funding of such stock by the issuance of debt securities at lower in-
terest costs or other preferred stocks at lower dividend costs." There-
tofore, the general redemption prices of preferred stocks had been
considered reasonable, within the meaning of the Statement of Pol-
icy, whenever such redemption prices did not exceed the sum of the
initial public offering price plus (1) 100 percent of the annual divi-
dend rate during the first 5 years, (2) 75 percent of the dividend
rate in the second 5 years, (3) 50 percent of the dividend rate in the
third 5 years, and (4) 25 percent of the dividend rate for the re-
mainder of the life of the stock. In conformity with this formula,
when the 5-year period of non-refundability authorized by the Com-
mission expires, the general redemption price at which the preferred
stock may then be called will be the same as it would have been if
there had been no restriction on refundability.
   The Commission's announcement stated that the modification of
the redemption policy would not apply to the redemption of pre-
ferred stock upon voluntary liquidation or to redemptions in

  55   Ohio Valley   Electric   Corporation, a $360 million bond issue;   United   Gas
Corporation, a $116 million bond issue; and Pennzoil Oompany, a $135 million note
issue maturing in 18 months sold to underwriters.

connection with mergers, sales of properties, or for other corporate
purposes, and that, upon the occurrence of any of such events, the
redemption price of the preferred stock was to be the same as if no
restriction on refundability had been authorized. The Commission
also emphasized that it would continuously review the effects of its
redemption policies, including specifically the foregoing modifica-
tion, and based upon experience with the modification make such ad-
justments in these policies as may from time to time be deemed ap-
propriate, including a rescission of the modification, extension of the
authorized five-year non-refunding period, or any other change
experience would warrant.
                             PART VII
    PARTICIPATION IN CORPORATE REORGANIZATIONS
    The Commission's role under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act,
 which provides a procedure for reorganizing corporations in the
 United States district courts, differs from that under the various
 other statutes which it administers. The Commission does not initi-
 ate Chapter X proceedings or hold its own hearings, and it has no
 authority to determine any of the issues in such proceedings. The
 Commission participates in proceedings under Chapter X in order
 to provide independent, expert assistance to the courts, the partici-
 pants, and investors in a highly complex area of corporate law and
 finance. It pays special attention to the interests of public security
holders who may not otherwise be represented effectively.
   "Wherethe scheduled indebtedness of a debtor corporation exceeds
 $3 million, Section 172 of Chapter X requires the judge, before ap-
 proving any plan of reorganization, to submit it to the Commission
 for its examination and report. If the indebtedness does not exceed
$3 million, the judge may, if he deems it advisable to do so, submit
the plan to the Commission before deciding whether to approve it.
'Vhen the Commission files a report, copies or a summary must be
sent to all security holders and creditors when they are asked to vote
on the plan. The Commission has no authority to veto a plan of
reorganization or to require its adoption.
   The Commission has not considered it necessary or appropriate to
participate in every Chapter X case. Apart from the excessive ad-
ministrative burden, many of the cases involve only trade or bank
creditors and few public investors. The Commission seeks to partici-
pate principally in those proceedings in which a substantial public
investor interest is involved. However, the Commission may also
participate because an unfair plan has been or is about to be pro-
posed, public security holders are not represented adequately, the re-
organization proceedings are being conducted in violation of impor-
tant provisions of the Act, the facts indicate that the Commission
can perform a useful sen-ice, or the judge requests the Commission's
participation.
   For purposes of carrying out its functions under Chapter X, the
Commission has divided the country into five geographic areas. The
     174
                   THIRTY-SIXTH   AKNUAL REPORT                   175
New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Seattle regional offices of
the Commission each have responsibility for one of these areas. Each
of these officeshas lawyers, accountants and financial analysts who
are engaged actively in Chapter X cases in which the Commission has
filed its appearance. Supervision and review of the regional offices'
Chapter X work is the responsibility of the Division of Corporate
Regulation of the Commission, which, through its Branch of Reor-
ganization, also serves as a field officefor the fifth area.
                      SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES
   In the fiscal year 1970, the Commission continued to maintain a
 high level of activity under Chapter X. It entered its appearance in
 19 new proceedings involving companies with aggregate stated assets
 of approximately $227 million and aggregate indebtedness of ap-
 proximately $156 million. The corporations involved in these pro-
 ceedings were engaged in a variety of businesses, including, among
 others, the manufacture of printing presses, textile machinery, and
 various steel products; the operation of a motor hotel, n ski resort,
and fast food restaurants; real estate dcvelopment ; computer serv-
ices; oil and gas drilling; and the sale of cemetery lots.
   Including the new proceedings, the Commission was a party in a
total of 107 reorganization proceedings during the year. The stated
assets of the companies involved in these proceedings totaled ap-
proximately $1.05 billion and their indebtedness totaled approxi-
mately $860 million. The proceedings were scattered among district
courts in 35 states and the District of Columbia as follows: 12 in
New York; 10 in California; 9 in Arizona; 5 each in Florida, New
Jersey, and Texas; 4 each in North Carolina, Louisiana, Pennsylva-
nia, Indiana, Illinois, and 'Vashington; 3 each in Oklahoma, South
Dakota, and Hawaii; 2 each in West. Virginia, Ohio, Kansas, Michi-
gan, Arkansas, Nevada, and Utah; 1 each in Maryland, the District
of Columbia, Tennessee, Alabama, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Colo-
rado, Iowa, Kentucky, Korth Dakota, "-isconsin, )Iinnesota, Mon-
tana, and Idaho.
   During the year, 12 proceedings were closed. As of the end of the
fiscal year the Commission was a party in 95 reorganization proceed-
ings.
 JURISDICTIONAL,   PROCEDURAL,    AND ADMINISTRATIVE      MATTERS
   In Chapter X proceedings in which it participates, the Commis-
sion seeks to have the courts apply the procedural and substantive
safeguards to which all parties are entitled. The Commission also at-
tempts to secure judicial uniformity in the construction of Chapter
X and the procedures thereunder.
176            SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

   In American National Trust and Republic National T1'ust,I the
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, as urged by the Commis-
sion, affirmed 2 an order of the district court dismissing a motion by
a certificate holder of the debtor trusts to vacate and set aside the
orders approving reorganization petitions which had been filed by
other certificate holders. The motion questioned the status of the pe-
titioning certificate holders as creditors of the debtors and the good
faith of the debtors' consent to the reorganization petitions. The
court of appeals stated that any objections to the standing of the pe-
titioning certificate holders as creditors of the trusts should have
been raised at the hearing at which the petitions were finally ap-
proved by the court and trustees appointed, and it held that the or-
ders approving the petitions had become final within the meaning of
Section 149 of Chapter X which provides that an order approving a
Chapter X petition which has become final is "a conclusive determi-
nation of the jurisdiction of the court,"
   Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, the Supreme Court
denied a petition for a writ of certiorari filed by the movant. In its
brief in opposition to that petition, the Commission contended that
the orders approving the petitions had become final, within the
meaning of Section 149, when the times for filing contravening an-
swers by the debtors or others pursuant to Sections 143 and 137 and
the time within which to appeal from those orders had expired; that
Section 149 precluded a subsequent vacation of the orders in the re-
organization court or through collateral attack in a state court; and
that, in view of the debtors' consent to the involuntary petitions,
there was no need to satisfy the additional requirement of an invol-
untary petition as to the creditor status of the petitioners.
   In Lniperiai '400' National, Inc.,3 the Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit affirmed an order of the reorganization court enjoin-
                         4


ing further prosecution in another court of an ordinary bankruptcy
proceeding on behalf of a partnership which had a 25 percent inter-
est in and operated a motel in which Imperial had a 75 percent
partnership interest," This motel is one of 97 motels each of which is
owned by a separate partnership in which Imperial has more than a
50 percent general partnership interest and the remaining partner-
ship interest is owned by local co-owners who operate the motel.

  Agreeing with the Commission, the court of appeals emphasized that
  broad jurisdiction is vested in the reorganization court in order to
  achieve complete reorganization of a debtor in the Chapter X pro-
  ceeding and that the term "property" as used in Section 111 of
  Chapter X, which gives the reorganization court" ... exclusive ju-
  risdiction of the debtor and its property, wherever located", should
  be broadly construed. The court also rejected the use of a "separate
  entity" concept of a partnership where strict adherence to it could
  defeat the broad purposes of reorganization. In that connection, the
  court restated in the following words the rationale of its landmark
 opinion in In re Pittsburqli Railways Co.: "In order to effectuate
                                                       G


 the purpose of Chapter X proceedings ... traditional concepts of
 property, title and separate entities may have to give way."
     In another case concerning the motel involved in the appeal dis-
 cussed above/ the court of appeals affirmed an order which had en-
 joined the lessor of the property on which the motel is situated from
 terminating the lease and obtaining possession of the premises,
 which had been constructed with Imperial's funds. In reaching its
 conclusion, the court construed the lease liberally in order to avoid a
 forfeiture.
     In Federal Shopping TVay, f1W.,8 as previously reported," the
 Commission participated in the debtor's appeal to the Court of Ap-
 peals for the Ninth Circuit from the order of the district court ap-
 proving the petition for reorganization. The principal question was
 whether the appointment of a receiver pendente lite constituted the
 act of bankruptcy necessary to allow an involuntary petition for re-
organization pursuant to Section 131(5) of Chapter X of the Bank-
ruptcy Act. A related appeal from the district court's order by the
.Washington State Insurance Commissioner has been dismissed; only
the debtor's appeal remains. In addition, an indictment was returned
charging five of the debtor's promoters and officers with violations
of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the
Federal mail fraud and conspiracy statutes." The above matters
were pending at the close of the fiscal year.

  companies, were engaged primarily in the business of operating bus
  lines in New Jersey and vicinity. In affirming the order of the dis-
  trict court which had granted the Commission's Section 328 mo-
  tion," the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit 14 agreed with the
  Commission that the proposed plan of arrangement under Chapter
  XI (which would have turned the companies over to the creditors,
  including the public noteholders) was not sufficient to protect the
  public investors and that the full safeguards of a Chapter X pro-
  ceeding were required. Thereafter, amended petitions under Chapter
  X were filed for nineteen of the twenty-six corporations. However,
  when the trustee sought to extend the Chapter X proceeding to in-
  clude the remaining seven corporations, answers were filed by two
  groups of creditors.
     One group of creditors opposed the trustee's attempt to extend the
 Chapter X proceedings to four corporations which were indirectly
 wholly-owned by the parent. Pursuant to a settlement, supported by
 the Commission, Chapter X petitions for three of the four corpora-
 tions were dismissed with the stipulation that if the financial condi-
 tions of those companies deteriorated, the trustee could then file
 Chapter X petitions for them. The financial conditions of all three
 companies did deteriorate and the trustee filed Chapter X petitions
 which were approved without opposition.
     The second group of creditors opposed the extension of the Chap-
 ter X proceeding to three additional subsidiaries of the parent,
 claiming, among other things, that the group had a secured interest
 in all of the stock of those companies. The referee found that no
valid pledge existed and that the Chapter X proceeding should be
extended to cover the three companies. The Commission took the po-
sition that, on the basis of In re Pittsburgh Railways,15 extension
was both appropriate and necessary for the purpose of effectuating a
unitary administration of the companies. The district court con-
firmed the referee's report and extended the Chapter X proceedings
to include the three companies. An appeal to the Court of Appeals
for the Third Circuit was dismissed pursuant to stipulation. All 26
companies of the Manufacturers' Group are now under Chapter X.

  the trustee to reject, as executory, a contract which provided for the
  construction and sale to the debtors of a shopping center plaza and
  to order the return by the seller to the debtors of cash and rea]
  property found by the court to have been transferred by the debtors
  as security for the performance of the contract. The Court of Ap-
  peals for the Seventh Circuit 17 affirmed the rejection of the contract
  but reversed that portion of the order directing the return of the
  cash and real property on the basis that such order exceeded the
  summary jurisdiction of the court because the property was in the
  actual possession of the seller under a substantial adverse claim. The
  Commission had taken the position that the reorganization court
  had properly exercised its inherent equity power to restore the par-
  ties to their positions before the contract and thereby to avoid a
  windfall for the seller at the expense of the debtors' creditors and
 public investors.
     In Landmark Inns of Durham, Inc.,18 the debtor had leased cer-
 tain lands in 1964 for a term of 52 years. Pursuant to the lease, the
 debtor built and operated a motel on the property. In 1969, the land-
 lords, alleging various breaches of the lease agreement, including
 failure to make timely rental and mortgage payments, petitioned the
 Chapter X court to declare a forfeiture of the lease. The Commis-
 sion, citing In re Fleetwood Motel 00rp.,19 argued that it would be
 inequitable to permit the landlords to secure possession of the debt-
 or's principal asset as the result of a forfeiture, thereby defeating
 any possibility of a reorganization of the debtor in which the public
 had a substantial investment., After the close of the fiscal year, the
 referee denied the landlords' petition.
    In R. Hoe & 00., Inc.,20 involving a major manufacturer of print-
ing presses, the trustee sought authorization to sell the debtor's prin-
cipal asset, its press division, outside of a plan of reorganization.
The Commission took the position that Section 116(3) of Chapter X
did not authorize such sale and that a sale would be tantamount to a
plan of reorganization stripped of the numerous statutory safe-
guards inherent in Chapter X. The district court, however, held that
the sale was desirable and authorized it pursuant to Sections 115
and 116(3) of Chapter X.

 preme Court reversed 23 the decision of the Court of Appeals 24
 which had affirmed an order of the district court confirming a plan
 of reorganization, which provided, among other things, for compro-
 mises of major claims without hearings on the merits of objections
 to the claims or on the merits of the compromises. After an exten-
 sive evidentiary hearing before a special master on the smaller of
 the two disputed claims which the Supreme Court had remanded for
 further investigation, the trustee proposed a compromise of the
claim. This compromise was opposed by the Protective Committee
 for Independent Stockholders. The Commission, although it had res-
 ervations as to the merits of certain aspects of the trustee's pro-
 posed compromise, determined that the compromise as a whole was
not unreasonable in light of the extensive evidentiary record devel-
oped before the special master, and therefore did not oppose it. At
the close of the fiscal year, the matter was still pending.
   In Spanish Language Television of Arizona, Inc.,25 a proceeding
in which the Commission was not participating, the Commission
called the court's attention to the fact that since the trustee whom
the court had appointed had been an employee of the debtor within
1 year prior to the commencement of the reorganization proceeding,
he was not disinterested within the meaning of Section 158 of the
Bankruptcy Act. Shortly thereafter the trustee resigned and a suc-
cessor trustee was appointed. In York International B1tilding, Inc.,26
also a non-participating case, the Commission secured the with-
drawal of a claim of a corporation in which the trustee owned a
substantial amount of stock in order to enable the trustee to meet
the standard of disinterestedness established by Section 158.
                          TRUSTEE'S    INVESTIGATION
  A complete accounting for the stewardship of corporate affairs by
the prior management is a requisite under Chapter X. One of the
primary duties of the trustee is to make a thorough study of the
debtor to assure the discovery and collection of all assets of the
estate, including claims against officers,directors, or controlling per-
sons who may have mismanaged the debtor's affairs. The staff of the
Commission often aids the trustee in his investigation.

   In Oommonwealth Financial 001'p.,27 as previously reported," the
former president of the debtor had moved for a protective order
staying any attempts by the trustee to take his deposition in the
course of the trustee's Section 167 investigation, on the ground that
the Commission had no right to participate in that investigation. He
alleged that the Commission was conducting a separate and inde-
pendent investigation of the affairs of the debtor, including his ac-
tivities, and that any information obtained by the Commission
might be later used against him in a related criminal proceeding.
The district court had denied the motion and the Court of Appeals
for the Third Circuit had affirmed." The depositions of the former
president and the former secretary and counsel of the debtor were
taken, but both witnesses asserted their privileges against self-
incrimination.
                REPORTS ON PLANS OF REORGANIZATION
   Generally, the Commission files a formal advisory report only in a
 case which involves a substantial public investor interest and pre-
 sents significant problems. When no such formal report is filed
the Commission may state its view briefly by letter, or authorize its
counsel to make an oral or written presentation to amplify the Com-
 mission's views.
   During the fiscal year the Commission published one formal ad-
 visory report.s" Its views on nine other plans were transmitted to the
 court either orally or by written memoranda.v
   The Commission's only formal advisory report of the year 32
dealt with the trustee's plan for the reorganization of Jade Oil &
Ga8 00.,33 a small, independent oil company. Although the company
had a history of losses and was insolvent on a book basis, the plan
gave the debtor's old common stockholders a 44 percent interest in
the reorganized enterprise. The trustee's approach was based on the

premise that small, independent exploratory oil companies are val-
ued on the basis of projected cash flow rather than on the basis of
probable "earnings" computed in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. The Commission agreed that prospective cash
flow was a key factor in the case, but pointed out that the cash flow
concept must be used with caution, particularly in the case of a
small oil company because (1) oil and gas are wasting assets; and
 (2) by making no provision for depletion, cash flow analysis makes
no allowance for the need to generate funds to finance the explora-
tion and development without which the enterprise is doomed to
eventual extinction. The Commission also noted that the trustee had
capitalized anticipated cash flow at a very high rate, which was said
to have been based on the multiples at which the stocks of other
small, speculative oil companies sold, and it observed that "market
data that merely reflect composite assessments of the odds for or
against lucky strikes and sensational finds-assessments shaped in
large measure by extravagant intangibles-are        much too shaky a
foundation for judicial findings as to value and fairness." The Com-
mission found that the stockholders' interest in the company was
marginal at best. Accordingly, it concluded that the trustee's plan
was unduly generous to the old stockholders at the expense of the
public investors who held the debtor's debentures and of other unse-
cured creditors.
   The Commission also found the proposed capital structure un-
sound. It noted that since the company was an oil company of the
wildcat type, its stock would be extremely speculative in any event.
That characteristic was to be accentuated by the plan, which called
for the issuance of large quantities of preferred stock. The preferred
would pre-empt such asset values and earning power as the company
had, leaving the common an essentially spurious security. Moreover,
the number of common shares to be issued was extremely large. This
was bound to make the common stock even more volatile than it
would otherwise be. The Commission recommended a simple all-com-
mon capital structure with a much smaller number of outstanding
common shares than that envisaged by the plan.
   One of the plan's key features was a proposal for raising the
funds needed in order to consummate it through the sale of a new
cumulative preferred. Since the company would be unable to pay
cash dividends on this preferred, it was planned to pay dividends in
common stock. The Commission observed that under this proposal
the new investors' interest in the enterprise would be progressively
enlarged at the expense of its old creditors. In addition, purchasers
of the preferred were to receive a large number of warrants enti-
tling them to purchase common stock. The Commission considered
                        THIRTY-SIXTH   ANNUAL REPORT                       183
  these warrants inconsistent with the standards of Chapter X because
  they added still another speculative complication to an already du-
  bious capital structure and gave the purchasers of the new preferred
  an opportunity for gain unaccompanied by any risk of loss and be-
  cause their effect would be to give the new investors a dispropor-
 tionate share of any future increments in the value of the business.
 The Commission was mindful of the high risks that the new inves-
 tors would assume and of the need for appropriate compensatory in-
 centives. It suggested, however, that such incentives be supplied by
 giving the new preferred a larger share of the total equity than the
 plan would have given rather than by way of warrants and massive
 stock dividends.
    Although the district court did not agree with all of the Commis-
 sion's criticisms and sustained an allocation of the equity interest in
 the reorganized company that the Commission believed unfair to
 creditors, it did impose severe limitations on the benefits to be given
 the purchasers of the new preferred." The court refused to approve
 the plan unless amended so as to condition both the exercisability of
 the warrants and the declaration of the proposed common stock divi-
 dends on the new preferred on the attainment of a prescribed level
of earnings. That level had not been reached at any time in the com-
pany's history, and there was no reasonable prospect of its being
reached in the foreseeable future. Hence the warrants and the divi-
dend rights of the new preferred were stripped of all practical effect.
    The plan was amended to conform to the court's holding, voted on
favorably by creditors and stockholders, and thereafter confirmed.
Consummation was deferred, however, until the new preferred issue
had been sold to the public. After the close of the fiscal year, a Se-
curities .Act registration statement with respect to that issue became
effective," A public offering followed.

court of appeals granted the Commission'spetition for a writ of mandamus re-
quiring the district jndge to permit the Commission to cross-examine wit-
nesses and to offer evidence. The court of appeals noted that limitations on
the extent to which the Commissioncould participate in Chapter X proceed-
ings would hamper it severely in carrying out its tasks as adviser to the court
and protector of the public Interest.

  The plan called for continuing the company's consumer finance busi-
  ness. But that was incidental. Its main feature was a proposal for
  putting the debtor into the real estate business. The group of pro-
  moters who put the plan forward owned a large tract of heavily
  mortgaged, unimproved land. Under the plan they were to transfer
  that land to the reorganized company in exchange for a controlling
 block of its common stock." Funds for an ambitious program of
 land development and for the rehabilitation of the company's badly
 debilitated loan business were to come from a projected post-reorga-
 nization public offering of a million shares of the reorganized com-
 pany's common stock, at $10 a share. Although their plan turned on
 this hoped-for financing, the prospective reorganizers had been una-
 ble to obtain any underwriters. They stated that they hoped to inter-
 est some securities houses in the financing after the reorganization
 had been consummated.
    The Commission found the plan unfeasible. Pointing out that
 there was no assurance that the massive flotation of new securities
 on which it turned would meet with a favorable reception in the
market place, the Commission's memorandum observed that "without
 such successful offering the plan is merely a union of an ailing and
 anemic debtor and a barren real estate speculation." Accordingly,
 the Commission urged that the plan be amended so as to defer con-
summation and to reserve the court's jurisdiction over the debtor
 until the proceeds of the contemplated public offering had been
received.
    The proponents then amended their plan on several occasions.
After lengthy hearings, a simple plan was finally developed as a re-
sult of negotiations among the Commission's staff, the trustee, and
the proponents. The land acquisition and the projected public offer-
ing that had figured so prominently in the original plan were
dropped. Instead, the reorganizers undertook to contribute cash to
the reorganized enterprise. The Commission found this plan consist-
ent with the statutory standards and recommended its approval.
After the close of the fiscal year, an order of approval was entered.
Creditors and stockholders then voted in favor of the plan, which
was subsequently confirmed.
    At the Commission's insistence, the plan included certain
special investor protection features. The history of the proceeding
showed that the plan proponents, who were to hold a controlling
block of the reorganized company's stock and would also be its
  3S Extensive cross-examination of the proponents of the plan by Commission
counsel showed that the cost of the land to the proponents had been materially
overstated and that one of the two mortgages by which the property was en-
cumbered had recently been created by the proponents in their own favor.
                        THIRTY -SIXTH         ANNUAL   REPORT      185
  directors and officers, had a strong self interest in selling unim-
 proved land to the reorganized company. It was also apparent that
 the proponents were likely to attempt to cause the reorganized com-
 pany to confer large stock options on them. The Commission main-
 tained that fairness required that decisions on these extremely im-
 portant subjects be made after reorganization by a majority of the
 disinterested shareholders. After the court had indicated its agree-
 ment with the Commission's views, a provision was added to the
 plan requiring that for a period of 5 years after the plan's consum-
 mation purchases of unproductive real estate (other than those in
 the normal course of the reorganized company's business), the grant
 of stock options to officersand directors, and amendments to the cer-
 tificate of incorporation be approved by a majority of the stock-ex-
 clusive of the stock owned of record or beneficially by the propo-
 nents of the plan.
    In First Holding Oorp.,39 the plan provided that creditors whose
 claims were secured by mortgages were to receive real estate con-
 tracts receivable at face value in satisfaction of their claims. Non-
public, unsecured creditors were to be issued 6 percent installment
notes, while the public holders of the debtor's "collateral trust notes"
and "convertible secured bonds" would receive the entire equity in-
terest in the reorganized company. The Commission pointed out that
the proposed plan was unfair in that it gave non-public creditors an
unjustified preference over the public investors who held the debtor's
"collateral trust notes" and "secured bonds". The Commission
stressed that the holders of these "secured" bonds and notes might
well be secured creditors and, if not, that they were at least unse-
cured creditors who should be treated equally with the other general
creditors. The court, however, approved the plan.
   In Oanandaigua Enterprises       Oorporationc» as previously re-
ported," the district court considered a new plan of reorganization
after vacating its order confirming a prior plan. The new plan,
among other things, provided for stockholder participation, and
payment to unsecured creditors of 50 percent in cash, with the re-
mainder, including accrued debenture interest, to be paid in pre-
ferred stock of the reorganized company. The Commission opposed
the new plan on the grounds that it was neither fair, equitable, nor
feasible. The Commission found the plan unfair because, among
other things, it provided for stockholder participation in the reorga-
nization of an insolvent company. The Commission also stated that

the plan was not feasible because there was no showing that the re-
 organized company would be able to raise approximately $5.4 mil-
lion, the amount payable on redemption of the preferred stock 5
years after consummation, and because the plan established a reorga-
nized company with an unsound capital structure in relation to its
 asset value and foreseeable earnings. The court approved the new
plan and, over the objections of the Commission, confirmed it.
   The indenture trustee for debenture holders appealed to the Court
 of Appeals for the Second Circuit from the orders of the district
 court vacating confirmation of the prior plan of reorganization and
 approving the new plan.v Subsequently, the new plan was accepted by
 89 percent of the principal amount of debenture holders voting, and
the indenture trustee moved to dismiss its appeal. While the Commis-
sion felt that the indenture trustee had a right to withdraw its appeal,
it urged the court of appeals to preserve the opportunity for any
debenture holder who might so desire to continue this appeal since
the time for appeal from either order had expired and debenture
holders might have relied on the trustee's appeal to protect their
interests."
   In line with the Commission's recommendation, the court of ap-
peals instructed the indenture trustee to notify all debenture holders
at its expense of the fact that it was seeking to dismiss the appeal.
The notice, which was to be approved by the district court, was to
include an explanation of the reasons why the trustee took the ap-
peal initially and why it now believed that the appeal should be dis-
missed and to state that any debenture holder who desired to con-
tinue the appeal could within 15 days substitute himself for the
indenture trustee as appellant.
   In The Lusk Oorporation,u the trustee proposed a plan calling for
liquidation of the debtor's assets and distribution of the proceeds to

  42 CA. 2, Nos. 34239 and 33330.
  43 The Commission argued that: (1) the motion to dismiss the appeal pre-
sented a situation not unlike that contemplated by Rule 23(e) of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides that a class action may not be dis-
missed without approval of the court and specifies that notice of a proposed
dismissal shall be given to all members of the class; (2) the representative as-
pect of persons taking an appeal in a Chapter X proceeding was noted in
Yaung v. Higbee 00., 324 U.S. 204 (1945), where the Supreme Court stated
that two preferred stockholders who had appealed from an order confirming a
Chapter X reorganization plan were representatives of the class of stockhold-
ers, even though the appellants there expressly disclaimed any intention to
represent the class; and (3) in the case at bar, a fortiori, the indenture trus-
tee as fiduciary for the class of debenture holders should not be permitted to
withdraw its appeal without adequate protection for the entire class.

   its creditors, including public investors holding the debtor's subordi-
   nated debentures. Since those proceeds were insufficient to cover the
   creditors' claims, shareholders could not participate. Although the
  debtor's stock was worthless, the plan provided for the sale of such
  stock by the trustee to the debtor's former chief executive. The Com-
  mission pointed out that the purpose of this sale was obscure and
  that the proposal appeared to call for judicial approval of a scheme
  for perpetuating a mere corporate shell. Accordingly, the Commis-
  sion urged that the plan be amended so as to defer the sale of the
  debtor's stock until evidence had been taken and a full record made
  with respect to the purpose and probable consequences of the pro-
  posed sale. The plan was amended in accordance with the Commis-
  sion's suggestion. At the close of the fiscal year, the matter had not
  as yet been brought on for hearing.
     In Olute 001'p.,45 the court, as recommended by the Commission,
  approved a plan which provided, among other things, for a compro-
  mise treating defrauded stockholders as creditors, but limiting each
  such stockholder's claim to half of the market price at the time of
  purchase.
     In Oontinental Vending Machine Oorp.,48 the plan called for the
 liquidation of an insolvent enterprise and for participation by the
 public investors who held the debtor's subordinated debentures in
 the proceeds of the liquidation. Their right to participate stemmed
 from a controversy between them and the indenture trustee, who was
 also a senior creditor. The debenture holders and the debtor's trustee
 had contended that the indenture trustee, a commercial bank, had
 breached its fiduciary duties to the debenture holders by (1) making
 loans to the debtor which had the effect of artificially prolonging its
 existence and causing its financial position to deteriorate further to
 the debenture holders' detriment; 41 and (2) failing to take appro-
priate action to prevent the debtor's chief executive from diverting
its funds to ventures of his own. The plan reflected a settlement by
which the indenture trustee agreed to waive its senior position for
 the debenture holders' benefit, enabling the debenture holders to
recover approximately 18 percent of their claims. After the Commis-
sion advised that the settlement was fair and that it considered the
distribution to junior creditors thereunder consistent with the abso-
lute priority rule, the plan was approved and confirmed.

reorganized company to issue stock which would be purchased by
Triton Corp., the debtor's controlling stockholder. As consideration
for the stock, Triton Corp. would contribute the cash necessary for
the consummation of the plan and the payment of all administration
costs through the final decree. Under the plan, the secured creditors
were to receive the full value of their security upon its sale or other
disposition. Holders of thrift certificates, investment accounts, de-
bentures and all other unsecured creditors whose claims amounted to
$100 or less were to receive a 40 percent cash payment. Those unse-
cured creditors and public investors whose claims were larger could
choose between 40 percent in cash to be paid within 15 months after
confirmation, or Triton Corp.'s own 4 percent non-cumulative, con-
vertible preferred stock equal to the face amount of their claims.
The debtor's preferred and common stock were to be cancelled, since
the court found the debtor to be insolvent. The Commission advised
the court that the plan failed to meet the statutory standards and
purpose of Chapter X because (1) the plan was unfair and also vio-
lated Section 216(12) (a) by reason of its failure to provide for the
election of directors by preferred stockholders in the event of a de-
fault in the payment of dividends to the preferred stock; (2) the
turning over of the debtor's causes of action to the reorganized com-
pany violated Section 216(13); and (3) the absence of a provision
for periodic reports to security holders violated Section 216(12) (b).
The plan was amended to meet the Commission's objections, and
then approved and confirmed by the court.
   In Little Missouri Minerals Association, Ine.,49 the trustee and the
debtor each proposed a plan of reorganization. The court agreed
with the Commission that the plan proposed by the trustee was fair,
equitable and feasible while the debtor's plan was not. The trustee's
plan called for the liquidation of the debtor, which had acquired
mineral interests from individual landowners by fraud, and for the
return of those interests to the defrauded landowners in exchange
for the Class A stock originally issued to them. The debtor's plan
provided for the company's restoration to its pre-reorganization sta-
tus, with the mineral rights and corporate control continuing to re-
side with the former management. The Commission opposed the
debtor's plan because it was manifestly unfair in keeping both the
mineral rights acquired by fraud and corporate control in the hands
of the former management. The Commission also pointed out that
there was no prospect of obtaining the favorable vote required for
confirmation.

   In Rancho Montana de Oro, Inc.,50 a plan was proposed whereby
all of the assets of the debtor were to be sold to an unrelated corpo-
ration in exchange for a large block of the purchaser's stock. This
stock was then to be sold by the trustee to an investment banker for
the purpose of public distribution, with the proceeds to be distrib-
uted to the debtor's creditors and sole stockholder. Since the plan
proposed the sale of securities to the public without registration
under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, the Commission inter-
vened in the Chapter X proceeding solely for the purpose of enforc-
ing the Federal securities laws. While the Commission agreed with
the contention of the trustee and the debtor that Section 3 (a) (10) of
the Securities Act would exempt the transaction between the pur-
chaser-issuer and the trustee from the registration requirements of
that Act, it contended that the exemption did not extend to any
public offering by the trustee of the securities to be received. After a
 hearing on the plan the district. judge, in a minute order, rejected
the Commission's objections and approved the plan. The Commission
filed a notice of appeal from the minute order." The formal order
subsequently entered upon the district judge's minute order held
only that the Section 3(a) (10) exemption applied to the proposed
transaction between the issuer and the trustee. The district judge ex-
pressly refused to find that the exemption would apply if the trustee
sold the purchaser-issuer's stock to the public. The trustee then
agreed to amend the plan so as to provide for the distribution of
such stock directly to the administrative claimants and to the debt-
or's creditors in satisfaction of their claims with the balance to be
distributed to the debtor's sole stockholder.
              ACfIVITIES WITH REGARD TO ALLOWANCES
   Every reorganization case ultimately presents the difficult problem
of determining the compensation to be paid to the various parties
for services rendered and for expenses incurred in the proceeding.
The Commission, which under Section 242 of the Bankruptcy Act
may not receive any allowance for the services it renders, has sought
to assist the courts in assuring economy of administration and in al-
locating compensation equitably on the basis of the claimants' con-
tributions to the administration of estates and the formulation of
plans. During the fiscal year 223 applications for compensation to-
taling about $5.4 million were reviewed.

  51 The Commission, having intervened solely for the purpose of enforcing the
federal securities laws, took the position that the limitation of Section 208 (11
U.S.C. fi608) respecting appeals by the Commission in Chapter X proceedings
was inapplicable. See S.B.a. v. Bloomberg, 299 F. 2d 315 (CoA. 1, 1962).
190                SECURITIES        AND EXCHANGE      COMMISSION

     In a decision involving Imperial '¥JO' National, Inc., the Court of
  Appeals for the Third Circuit considered an award of interim fee
  allowances by the district court to the reorganization trustee and his
  attorney. These allowances-$90,000 to the trustee and $125,000 to
 his attorney-were the third interim allowances during the reorgani-
  zation proceeding and were based not only on their work during the
 third period but also on a reconsideration of services performed dur-
 ing the entire reorganization. The court of appeals reversed the
 order, holding that the district court had erred in considering the
 work done by the fee applicants during the entire reorganization
 proceedings, in the absence of a showing "that the previous interim
  awards did not adequately relieve any burden arising out of their
 service during the first two periods"," The court of appeals found
 the fees awarded to have been excessive when viewed in light of
 services performed during the third period. Because the record did
 not indicate what allowances of compensation would be necessary in
 order that the administration of the debtor's estate would be carried
 out as of the termination of the third period, the court held that the
 fee applicants had not sustained their burden of proof and re-
 manded the case to the district court for definite findings and con-
 clusions unless the creditors agreed to the allowances recommended
 by the Commission for the third period-$27,500 to the trustee and
 $45,000 to his attorney. In this connection, the court observed that
 the recommendations of the Commission on this matter "should be
 given great weight ... [b]ecause of its experience in such matters, its
 impartiality, and its sole familiarity with the relevant facts of this
 case".
    In TMT Trailer Ferry, Inc.,53 as previously reported;" attorneys
 for the Protective Committee for Independent Stockholders applied
for an interim allowance of $100,000for services rendered and more
than $20,000 reimbursement of expenses. Because the committee had
rendered services for over 10 years and because the major services
related to successful opposition to confirmed plans of reorganization,
the Commission supported the application in principle but recom-
mended an interim allowance of $60,000 for services rendered and
$10,000 reimbursement of expenses. The attorney for the successor
trustee, who had previously obtained an em parte order from the dis-
trict court vacating the court's previous determination that commit-
tee counsel were entitled to an interim award, opposed counsel's
renewed application. He alleged that counsel had represented con-

  flieting interests in attempting to obtain creditor status for those
  stockholders who were allegedly de:frauded in the purchase of their
 stock and that the committee had exceeded the authority given it by
 stockholders in opposing reorganization plans which provided for no
 participation by stockholders in the reorganized company. The dis-
 trict court allowed committee counsel interim compensation of only
 $10,000 and $5,000 reimbursement of expenses.
     Trustee's counsel had also proposed that the depositions of the in-
 dividual members of the committee and committee counsel be taken
 and that this be done in Florida. The committee and its counsel ap-
 plied to the district court for a protective order from the depositions
 and for instructions as to future participation in the reorganization
 proceeding. Since the committee members lived in New York and
 California, committee counsel lived in the District of Columbia and
 Florida, the facts which the trustee's counsel sought in his proposed
 depositions were, in the view of the Commission, either already a
 matter of record, irrelevant, or based on erroneous legal assump-
 tions, and the activities of trustee's counsel tended to discourage ac-
 tive participation in the reorganization proceeding by representa-
tives of public investors, the Commission supported the committee's
 motion for a protective order and instructions. The district court de-
nied the motion.
     The committee and its counsel obtained leave :from the Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to file an appeal seeking revision of
the compensation award to the amounts originally requested. The
Commission urged the court to increase the award to the amounts it
had recommended to the district court. In addition, the committee
and its counsel, with the Commission's support, appealed separately
the district court's denial of its motion for a protective order and in-
structions. At the close of the fiscal year both appeals were still
pending.
    In Oanandaigua Enterprises OmjJoration,65 the trustee, who had
been granted a first interim allowance of $100,000 in the prior year,
applied for a second interim allowance of $200,000 for services ren-
dered by himself and his law firm 56 since the beginning of the pro-
ceeding. The Commission urged that the application be viewed as
separate requests for interim allowances by the trustee and his law
firm, since the services rendered were by separate persons and distin-
guishable. The Commission also contended that the application

  66 No attorney for the trustee was appointed during these proceedings. In the
interest of economy the court advised the trustee to act as his own attorney,
and, if necessary, to utilize the services of members of his firm.
192            SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

should be viewed as a request for an interim allowance for the 9%
month period since entry of the order granting the first interim al-
lowance, because an adjustment of the first award, absent unusual
circumstances not present in this case, would militate against orderly
administration of the estate. Accordingly, the Commission recom-
mended awards of $7,500and $10,000to the trustee and his law firm,
respectively. The court, however, granted a single award of $100,000
to the trustee as an additional allowance on account of services ren-
dered since the inception of the proceeding in December 1964.
   In Manufacturers' Oredit Oor-porationr" as previously reported,"
the court granted the Commission's motion under Section 328, and
subsequently approved Chapter X petitions for the parent corpora-
tion and 18 subsidiaries. The Chapter XI receiver and his two attor-
neys sought interim allowances totaling $150,000 from the Chapter
X and XI estates for services rendered while the debtors were in
Chapter XI. The referee recommended interim awards of $40,000to
the receiver and $35,000 to each of his attorneys, allocating 70 per-
cent to the Chapter X companies and 30 percent to the Chapter XI
companies on the basis of the relative income of the debtors involved
rather than of services rendered. The Commission opposed the
award of interim allowances, urging that in Chapter X, in order to
assure the prompt and efficient rendition of services, interim allow-
ances are appropriate for officersof the court who continue to render
substantial services to the estate, but not to the Chapter XI receiver
and his attorneys whose services had, for the most part, ceased. The
Commission also pointed to the stringent cash position of the estate.
The district court confirmed the referree's report and granted the in-
terim allowances, but provided for installment payments over a pe-
riod of 6 months.
   In Roberts Oornpany,59 the trustee and his two attorneys made ap-
plication for interim compensation at the rate of $4,000 per month
each for the trustee and his senior attorney, and $2,000 per month
for the trustee's junior attorney. After an evidentiary hearing the
Commission filed a memorandum recommending that the maximum
interim compensation of the trustee and his senior attorney be set at
$3,000 per month. The Commission further recommended that the
trustee's junior attorney, who was not involved in the major func-
tions to be performed in the proceedings, be considered as function-
ing as the debtor's house counsel, and be compensated as such. It
recommended that he be retained at a salary of $2,000 per month,

 but that this be considered as payment in full. The referee agreed
 with the Commission's position regarding the application of the
 trustee and his senior attorney, but the district court awarded all ap-
plicants the full sums requested as interim compensation.
    In Swan-Finch Oil 00l'p.,60 the trustee, who had been granted
 $490,000 as a final allowance 4 years earlier, applied for a second
final allowance of $250,000 for services rendered since the previous
 award, and counsel for the trustee, who had received no prior
 award, applied for a final allowance of $162,500. The Commission
recommended a $60,000 allowance to the trustee in view of the sub-
stantial final allowance already awarded, the statement by the court
four years earlier that the trustee was expected to render some fur-
ther services for which he was to make no further claim, and the
lack of time records, balanced against the inherent complexity of the
estate and the trustee's contribution. The Commission recommended
$90,000 for counsel to the trustee in view of the facts that amounts
recovered for the estate while counsel served the trustee were not at-
tributable solely to his efforts, the services rendered in some measure
merely duplicated the trustee's work, and counsel could not be ex-
pected to be remunerated at the rates customarily charged private
clients in commercial matters. The court awarded $65,000 to the
trustee and $100,000to counsel for the trustee.
   In Webb &: K1UJ,pp, Inc.,61 counsel for the trustee and the trustee,
each of whom had been granted three interim allowances totaling
$335,000 and $60,000, respectively, applied for a fourth interim al-
lowance of $200,000 and $25,000, respectively, for services rendered
during a 22-month period. The Commission recommended deferral
of counsel's application with the alternative recommendation that if
the court were to make some award, it should not exceed $75,000.
The recommendation for deferral was based on the substantial
amount requested; the uncertainty as to what would be ultimately
available for final allowances, in view of a $35,000,000Internal Rev-
enue Service claim; the fact that most of the estate's assets had al-
ready been liquidated, making reorganization impossible; and the
substantial prior awards. The Commission recommended that no fur-
ther interim award be made to the trustee in view of the above fac-
tors and particularly since the trustee had not rendered such sub-
stantial services as to warrant an interim award in order to alleviate
economic hardship. After the close of the fiscal year, the court held
that a decision on the applications should be deferred so as to permit

clarification of the status of the tax claims, on which the future course
of the proceedings in large part depended.
               INTERVENTION IN CHAPTER XI PROCEEDINGS
   Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act provides a procedure by
 which debtors can effect arrangements with respect to their unse-
 cured debts under court supervision. Where a proceeding is brought
 under that chapter but the facts indicate that it should have been
brought under Chapter X, Section 328 of Chapter XI authorizes the
 Commission or any other party in interest to make application to
the court to dismiss the Chapter XI proceeding unless the debtor's
petition is amended to comply with the requirements of Chapter X,
or a creditors' petition under Chapter X is .filed.
   In Federal Ooal Oompany,62 the debtor had at the time of its or-
ganization made a public offering of units consisting of long-term
debentures and common stock. Massive interest arrearages accumu-
lated over the years because of the debtor's inability to pay the in-
terest due the debenture holders," When the debentures matured,
this accrued but unpaid interest was far in excess of the principal.
The debtor then sought to effect a Chapter XI arrangement with the
debenture holders, who were its only creditors. Under the proposed
arrangement persons whose debentures were in principal amounts of
less than $1,000 were to receive a modest cash settlement in full sat-
isfaction of their claims.'" The claims of those who held debentures
in the principal amount of $1,000 or more were to be scaled down to
40 percent of principal. These larger holders were to receive new
long-term debentures in that reduced amount. Contending that the
arrangement would effect a drastic revision of the rights of almost
2,000 public investor creditors and that the debtor's history raised
questions calling for an investigation by a disinterested Chapter X
trustee, the Commission moved for dismissal pursuant to Section
328. That motion was opposed by the debtor which argued that
Chapter XI was appropriate because its stock was held by the same
people who held its debentures. The district court rejected the debt-
or's contentions and granted the Commission's motion." In its opin-
ion the court pointed out that although all the debentures had origi-
nally been held by the stockholders in amounts directly proportional
to their stock holdings and although there was still a large degree of

  82   S.D. W. Va., No. 69-270.
  6B Interest was due only if earned. But the debenture holders were entitled
to accrued interest at maturity.
  84 The proposed payment was 30 percent of principal, whIch was only about

12 percent of the total of principal plus accrued interest.
  85 The opinion is unreported.
                        THIRTY-SIXTH   ANNUAL REPORT                     195
  overlapping between the debenture holders and the stockholders, the
  two groups were no longer identical. The court also stated that even
  had there been such identity, that factor would not be controlling
  because "the safeguards of Chapter X afford greater protection to
 creditors and stockholders alike by providing greater judicial con-
 trol over the entire proceedings, together with impartial and expert
 administrative assistance in corporate reorganizations through the
 active participation of the S.E.C., as well as the appointment of a
 disinterested trustee." From this determination the debtor appealed
 after the close of the fiscal year.
    In Seourity Saoesoo, Inc.,66 creditors made a Section 328 motion.
 When the court asked for the Commission's views with respect to
 that motion, the Commission appeared and participated in the devel-
 opment of an evidentiary record. After reviewing that record, the
 Commission advised the court that it was unable to support the mo-
 tion. The movants thereafter consented to the denial of their motion.
    The debtor dealt in single-family dwellings. It purchased such
 properties, assumed the mortgages to which they were subject, and
 then resold them to people who intended to occupy them. The buyers
 agreed to make stipulated monthly payments to the debtor over pro-
 tracted periods. A buyer was entitled to a deed only after he had
made all his payments. If a buyer was unable or unwilling to con-
tinue with his payments, the debtor would repossess the house. But
the debtor had no claim against such a defaulting buyer for the pay-
ments that were to be made over the remaining portion of the con-
tract period."
    The debtor had virtually no equity capital. The small amount of
stock that had been issued was held by management. The debtor had
financed itself by selling approximately $12 million of demand and
short-term debt securities to some 4,500 investors. Operations had
been unprofitable, with the resulting deficits being covered by the
sale of new debt securities. When continued deficit financing became
impossible, the debtor was constrained to seek relief under Chapter
XI. Shortly before the filing of the petition, the old control group
had sold its stock to an experienced entrepreneur, who had not pre-
viously been affiliated with the company. Concluding that the debt-
or's business was uneconomic and incapable of rehabilitation, new
management proposed a Chapter XI arrangement predicated on the
gradual liquidation of the debtor's inventory of repossessed homes

and real estate receivables, and reinvestment of the proceeds in types
of commercial financing with which the company's new chief execu-
tive had considerable previous experience.
   Under the proposed Chapter XI arrangement the public creditors
were to receive a 55 percent cash distribution over a 7-year period and
half of the equity interest in the reorganized company; the old stock
was to be extinguished; and the new chief executive would receive
the other half of the new stock in return for a contribution of new
assets and his undertaking to manage the company without compen-
sation until the public investors had received all of the cash distri-
butions to which they were entitled under the arrangement."
   The creditors who moved for dismissal of the Chapter XI pro-
ceeding contended that since the proposed arrangement entailed a
drastic revision of the rights of public creditors, Chapter XI was
unavailable. The debtor replied that Chapter XI was appropriate
because a complete change in management had already been effected
and because this Chapter XI proceeding, in view of the peculiar cir-
cumstances involved, was assertedly more akin in substance to a
Chapter X proceeding than to the normal Chapter XI proceeding.
The Commission noted its emphatic disagreement with the sugges-
tion that the proceeding was really tantamount to one under Chap-
ter X.
   In concluding that it was unable to support the creditors' motion,
the Commission stressed the uneconomic character of the debtor's
business, observing that "in the face of the debtor's history and the
character of its business, to speak of a 'reorganization' as that word
is generally understood in a Chapter X context is to engage in hy-
perbole." Relief under Chapter X being barred and liquidation
being a pressing economic necessity, the real question in the case was
whether the business was to be liquidated gradually in Chapter XI
or rapidly in ordinary bankruptcy. On that issue the Commission
took no position. Nor did it choose to express an opinion as to
whether Chapter XI permits the confirmation of an arrangement
under which an existing business is to be liquidated and the proceeds
used to launch a new and quite uncertain venture.
   The Commission suggested that if the court did confirm the ar-
rangement, certain amendments would be appropriate to assure the
public investors of representation on the board of directors and to
minimize the likelihood of uninformed, speculative trading in the

   68 No dividends or other distributions  are to be paid or accrued on the new
chief executive's shares until the creditors receive all of the cash to which the
plan entitles them.

new common stock, the value of which would remain conjectural for
many years.69
   Efforts are sometimes made to misuse Chapter XI so as to deprive
investors of the benefits of the Securities Act and the Securities Ex-
change Act. When such cases come to the attention of the Commis-
sion's staff, it normally attempts to resolve the problem by informal
negotiations with the debtor's counsel. When such negotiations prove
fruitless or there appears to be a deliberate effort to evade the stat-
utes administered by the Commission, the Commission intervenes in
the Chapter XI proceeding to assist in the development of an ade-
quate record, direct the court's attention to the applicable provi-
sions of the Federal securities laws, express its views as to their
bearing on the particular case, and thus discharge its statutory
investor protection responsibilities.
   In United States Research Oorporation." the debtor used decep-
tive materials in order to induce its creditors to consent to the pro-
posed arrangement. The funds needed to consummate the arrange-
ment were to come from an unregistered offering of additional stock
to present stockholders. That offering was already in progress and
was being made with the aid of the same misleading material that
had been disseminated to creditors. After the Commission had inter-
vened and developed the facts, the court adjudicated the debtor a
bankrupt.
   In Reoleite, Inc.,71 the proposed arrangement called for the issu-
ance of some 1.5 million shares of the debtor's stock to a small group
of persons who were to contribute certain properties to the debtor
and to take control of it after consummation." The plan of arrange-
ment stated that the shares in question were to be issued "pursuant
to Section 393 of the Bankruptcy Act", which exempts certain trans-

   69 The latter result was to be achieved by a sharp reduction in the number

of shares to be issued. Under the plan, as originally proposed, one share would
have been issued for each $10 in claims. The Commission recommended that
one share be issued for each $100 in claims.

   72 This was originally a Chapter X proceeding . .After six years of admlnis-

tration under that chapter, a plan was proposed which the Commission eonsld-
ered and which the court found unfeasible. See 35th Annual Report, p, 166.
The court then found that no plan of reorganization was feasible and adjudi-
cated the debtor 11 bankrupt. The proceeding thus became one in ordinary
bankruptcy. The debtor thereupon availed itself of the right to file a Chapter
XI petition given it by Section 321 of that chapter, which provides that "A
debtor may file a petition under this chapter in a pending bankruptcy proceed.

actions in securities issued to creditors in Chapter XI proceedings
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Com-
mission intervened to point out that this claim to an exemption from
registration was invalid. In urging the court to strike the offending
reference to Section 393 from the plan of arrangement, the Commis-
sion pointed to the text of that section, exempting from registration
under the Securities Act "any transaction in any security issued pur-
suant to an arrangement in exchange for claims against the debtor
or partly in exchange and partly for cash and/or property ... ", and
noted its historic position that the section applies only to transac-
tions with persons who were creditors at the time the petition was
filed. The Commission's memorandum said:
        "The prospective recipients of these shares have no 'claims against the
      debtor'. They are people who are eager to sell the debtor something in ex.
      change for its stock. Section 393 promotes arrangements between embar-
      rassed debtors and their creditors by facilltating the issuance of new se-
      curities by the former to the latter. It was not meant to enable promoters
      to manufacture 'free' stock for themselves by putting assets into a dor-
      mant corporation that happens to have wound up in Chapter XI."
    The debtor subsequently amended its arrangement so as to delete
 the incorrect claim to a Securities Act exemption. The amended ar-
 rangement was confirmed and consummated after the Commission's
 staff had made it clear to all concerned that the shares to be issued
 in exchange for property had to be taken for investment and not
 with a view to distribution pursuant to the exemption from registra-
 tion for "transactions by an issuer not involving any public offer-
ing" provided for by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, and that
any public offering of those shares would be unlawful unless such
offering were registered under the Securities Act or some exemption
from registration was available.
    SP01'ts Arenas, lna.,73 was another case in which an effort was
made to claim a Section 393 exemption for securities to be issued in
exchange for property to be contributed to the debtor rather than
for "claims against the debtor" of which Section 393 speaks. The
Commission intervened and succeeded in obtaining a commitment
from the prospective recipients to take the securities for investment.
The plan of arrangement that was eventually confirmed provided
that the shares to be issued in exchange for property would bear an
appropriate restrictive legend.

                     SUPPORTING ACTIVITIES
                   PUBLIC INFORMATION      SERVICES

Dissemination of Information
    As the discussion in prior sections of this Report indicates, most
 large corporations in which there is a substantial public investor in-
 terest have filed registration statements or registration applications
 under the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act with the
 Commission and are required to file annual and other periodic re-
 ports. Widespread public dissemination of the financial and other
 data included in these documents is essential if public investors gen-
 erally are to benefit by the disclosure requirements of the securities
 laws. This is accomplished in part by distribution of the prospectus
 or offering circular in connection with new offerings. Much of the
 data reflected therein and in the annual and other periodic reports is
 also reprinted and receives general circulation through the medium
of securities manuals and other financial publications, thus becoming
 available to broker-dealer and investment adviser firms, trust depart-
ments and other financial institutions and, through them, to public
investors generally. The documents mentioned above are also avail-
able for public inspection both at the officesof the Commission and
at the exchanges on which particular securities may be listed.
   Various activities of the Commission also facilitate public dissemi-
nation of information filed as well as other information. Among
these is the issuance of a daily "News Digest" which contains (1) a
resume of each proposal for the public offering of securities for
which a Securities Act registration statement is filed; (2) a list of
issuers of securities traded over-the-counter which have filed regis-
tration statements under the Securities Exchange Act; (3) a list of
companies which have filed periodic reports disclosing significant cor-
porate developments; (4) a summary of all notices of filings of ap-
plications and declarations, and of all orders, decisions, rules and
rule proposals issued by the Commission; (5) announcements of the
Commission's participation in corporate reorganization proceedings
under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act and of the filing of advi-
sory reports of the Commission on the fairness and feasibility of re-
organization plans; (6) a brief report regarding actions of courts in
     200
                   THIRTY-SIXTH     A1I."'NUALREPORT                201
 litigation resulting from the Commission's law enforcement pro-
 gram; and (7) a brief reference to each statistical report issued by
 the Commission. During the year, the News Digest included sum-
 mary reports on the 4,038 Securities Act registration statements filed
 with the Commission (not including investment company offering
proposals filed as amendments to previously filed statements), 1,099
notices of filings, orders, decisions, rules and rule proposals issued
by the Commission, 297 developments in litigation under its enforce-
ment program, 9 releases on corporate reorganization proceedings,
and 81 statistical releases.
    The News Digest is made immediately available to the press, and
it is also reprinted and distributed by the Government Printing
Office, on a subscription basis, to some 4,440 investors, securities
firms, practicing lawyers and others. In addition, the Commission
maintains mailing lists for the distribution of the full text of its or-
ders, decisions, rules and rule proposals.
    These informational activities are supplemented by public discus-
sions from time to time of legal, accounting and other problems aris-
ing in the administration of the Federal securities laws. During the
year, members of the Commission and various staff officers made
speeches before a number of professional, business and other groups
interested in the Federal securities laws and their administration
and participated in panel discussions of like nature. Participation in
these discussions not only serves to keep attorneys, accountants, cor-
porate executives and others abreast of developments in the adminis-
tration of those laws, but it also is of considerable value to the Com-
mission in learning about the problems experienced by those who
seek to comply with those laws. In order to facilitate such compli-
ance the Commission also issues, from time to time, general interpre-
tive releases and policy statements explaining the operation of par-
ticular provisions of the Federal securities laws and outlining
policies and practices of the Commission.
    PubIications.-In   addition to the daily News Digest, and releases
concerning Commission action under the Acts administered by it
and litigation involving securities violations, the Commission issues
a number of other publications, including the following:

Availability of Information   for Public Inspection
   The many thousands of registration statements, applications, dec-
larations, and annual and periodic reports filed with the Commission
each year are available for public inspection and copying at the
Commission's public reference room in its principal offices in Wash-
ington, D.C. Also available at that location are other documents con-
tained in Commission files and indexes of Commission decisions.
   The categories of materials which are available for public inspec-
tion and copying are specified in the Commission's rule concerning
records and information, 17 CFR 200.80, as revised to implement the
provisions of the Public Information Amendment to Section 3 of the
Administrative Procedure Act which became effective July 4, 1967.
The rule also establishes a procedure to be followed in requesting

  records or copies thereof, provides a method of administrative ap-
  peal from the denial of access to any record, and provides for the
  imposition of fees when more than one-half man-hour of work is
  performed by members of the Commission's staff to locate and make
  available records requested.
    The Commission has special public reference facilities in the New
  York and Chicago Regional Offices, and some facilities for public
  use in other regional and branch offices. Each regional office has
 available for public examination copies of prospectuses used in re-
 cent offerings of securities registered under the Securities Act; regis-
 tration statements and recent annual reports filed pursuant to the
 Securities Exchange Act by companies having their principal office
 in the region; broker-dealer and investment adviser applications
 originating in the region; letters of notification under Regulation A
 filed in the region; and indexes of Commission decisions. Additional
 material is available in the New York, Chicago and San Francisco
 regional offices.
    Members of the public may make arrangements through the public
 reference room at the Commission's principal officesto purchase cop-
 ies of material in the Commission's public files. The copies are pro-
 duced by a commercial copying company which supplies them to the
 public at prices established under a contract with the Commission.
 Current prices begin at 12 cents per page for pages not exceeding
 8%11 x 14" in size, with a $2 minimum charge. Under the same con-
tract, the company also makes microfilm and microfiche copies of
Commission public documents available on a subscription or individ-
ual order basis to persons or firms who have or can obtain viewing
facilities. In microfiche services, up to 60 images of document pages
are contained on 4'" x 6" pieces of film, referred to as "fiche." An-
nual microfiche subscriptions are offered in a variety of packages
covering all public reports filed on Forms 10-K, 9-K, 8-K,
N-1Q and N-1R under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the
Investment Company Act of 1940; annual reports to stockholders;
proxy statements; new issue registration statements; and final pros-
pectuses for new issues. The packages offered include various catego-
ries of these reports, including those of companies whose securities
are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock
Exchange, or regional stock exchanges, or traded over-the-counter,
and standard industry classifications (S.I.C.). Arrangements also
may be made to subscribe to reports of companies of one's own selec-
tion. The subscription services system may be extended to further
groups of filings in the future if demand warrants. The company
also will supply, at reasonable prices, copies in microfiche or micro-

 film form of other public records of the Commission desired by a
 member of the public. Microfiche readers and reader-printers have
 been installed in public reference areas in the Commission's head-
quarters officeand New York Regional Office,and sets of the micro-
 fiche are available for inspection there.
    Visitors to the public reference rooms of the Commission's 'Vash-
 ington, D.C., New York and Chicago officesalso may make immedi-
ate reproductions of material in those offices on coin-operated
 copying machines at a cost of 25 cents per 8%" x 14" page. The
 charge for an attestation with the Commission seal is $2. Detailed
information concerning copying services available and prices for the
various types of service and copies may be obtained from the Public
Reference Section of the Commission.
   Each year, many thousands of requests for copies of and informa-
tion from the public files of the Commission are received by the
Public Reference Section in Washington, D.C. During the 1970 fiscal
year, 12,496 persons examined material on file in 'Vashington and
several thousand others examined files in the New York, Chicago,
and other regional offices.More than 31,424 searches were made for
information requested by individuals and approximately 13,320 let-
ters were written with respect to information requested.
Rule Concerning Publication of Interpretative and "No-Action" Letters
   In September 1968, the Commission had published a request for
comments as to whether staff interpretative and "no-action" letters
should be made available to the public.' Interpretative letters are in-
formal opinions regarding the application of the law to contem-
plated factual situations. In a "no-action" letter, an authorized staff
official states with respect to a specified proposed transaction that
the staff will not recommend to the Commission that it take enforce-
ment action if the transaction is consummated in the manner de-
scribed in the incoming letter.
  The Commission received numerous comments in response to the
release, the overwhelming majority favoring public disclosure of the
matters treated in interpretative and "no-action" letters in one form
or another. It was suggested, however, that a means be found to give
confidential treatment to sensitive matters.
  Shortly after the end of the fiscal year, the Commission published
for comment a proposed rule (17 CFR 200.81) concerning the publi-
cation of interpretative and "no-action" letters, and subsequently it
adopted the rule in modified form."

                    THIRTY-SIXTH     ANNUAL REPORT                    205
     Section 200.81 provides that no-action and interpretative letters
   submitted on or after December 1, 1970 and the responses thereto
   will be available for public inspection or copying 30 days after the
  staff has given or sent the response to the person requesting it. In
  particular cases where it appears that a further delay in publication
  would be appropriate, the letter and response thereto will be given
  confidential treatment for a reasonable period not exceeding an addi-
  tional 90 days upon application therefor. The burden will be on the
  person requesting the no-action position or interpretation to estab-
  lish the need for confidential treatment and it will not be granted
  unless such need is clearly shown. Only in exceptional situations,
  such as mergers or acquisition programs, will the full 90-day period
 be allowed.
     It is contemplated that from time to time, where the subject mat-
  ter of a no-action or interpretative letter is of particular interest or
 importance, such letter and response thereto will be published in
 summarized form in the Commission's daily News Digest. This will
 call attention to the position taken in the staff's response and inter-
 ested persons can, if they so desire, inspect the full text of the letter
 and response thereto in the public file. In addition, copies of the let-
ter and response may be purchased at prescribed rates by writing to
 the Public Reference Room, Securities and Exchange Commission,
 'Washington, D.C. 20549.
    A note to paragraph (b) of the rule requires that all requests for
interpretative advice or a no-action position shall indicate in a sepa-
rate caption at the beginning of the request each section of the Act
or rule involved. If more than one section or rule is involved, a sepa-
rate copy of the request must be submitted for each such section or
rule and an additional copy for the use of the staff of the Commis-
sion. The note was added in response to comments on the proposed
rule which indicated concern that the requests and responses thereto
should be available in a form which will facilitate reference to those
relating to a particular section or rule.
    The Commission pointed out that no-action and interpretative re-
sponses by the staff are subject to reconsideration and should not be
regarded as precedents binding on the Commission.

                   ELECfRONIC    DATA PROCESSING

 During the 1970 fiscal year the Commission continued the imple-
mentation and improvement of existing and planned USI'S of EDP
which were described in previous annual reports. In addition, opera-
206             SECURITIES    AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

tional support was provided to the Institutional Investor Study for
the creation, editing and maintenance of its data files.
Extension of Application of Automation Techniques
     In a further expansion of the use of automation for analysis of
  data related to the financial structure of business and the economics
  and practices of the securities industry, several new systems were de-
  veloped and are currently in varying stages of implementation.
     One of these is a system for compiling and analyzing plant and
  equipment expenditure data reported quarterly by approximately
  1700 selected firms. This system, which became operational in the
 last quarter of the fiscal year, is one of the most important of the re-
 curring statistical programs conducted within the Office of Policy
  Research. It is used extensively within the Government by agencies
 involved in business and economic analysis and is crucial to Govern-
 ment decisions relating to monetary and fiscal policies.
    Another system, which can be categorized as a general purpose file
 management system, was developed primarily for use by the Institu-
 tional Investor Study for the creation and maintenance of the many
 data files to be used in its analysis of questionnaire data submitted by
 firms covered in the study. As a result of its successful use in that
 project, this program package is being applied by the permanent
 staff of the Commission to several of its new EDP projects.
    A coordinated effort was also begun to study the feasibility of uti-
 lizing the CUSIP numbering system in Commission reporting and
record-keeping activities. This numbering system provides a stand-
ard method for the identification of specific issuers and issues within
the securities industry. Another system, for which preliminary work
began in fiscal year 1970, is to be used for the compilation of pe-
riodic workload statistics and to generate various reports and analy-
ses reflecting complaint processing operations.
    As time and other resources permit, the use of EDP will be ex-
tended to other areas of Commission activities.
Assistance to State and Federal Agencies
   The Commission continued, during this past year, to provide
certain information from its computer files to State authorities,
self-regulatory institutions and other Federal agencies as described
in previous annual reports,"
Sharing of EDP Facilities
  During the past year the Commission continued its sharing ar-
rangement with the Naval Ship Engineering Center, Department of

 a See 34th Annual Report, p. 168; 35th Annual Report, p. 179.
                    THIRTY-SIXTH   ANNUAL REPORT                   207
the Navy. Under this arrangement the Commission provided appro.x~
imately 2400 hours of computer time at a significant savings to the
Government as compared with the prevailing rates of outside
sources. Due to changes in Department of the Navy programs, this
arrangement was terminated on June 30, 1970.
   In an effort to continue the important Government-wide sharing
program, the Commission entered into an arrangement to provide a
maximum of 150 hours of computer time to the General Accounting
Office in fiscal year 1971, and it is currently negotiating similar ar-
rangements with several other Federal agencies.
EDP Training
   During the year the Commission continued its training programs
geared to the specific needs of its computer specialists and operators.
The program is designed to enable the Commission's EDP staff to
utilize more advanced hardware and programs in the development
and implementation of new and revised computer systems.
               PERSONNEL   AND FINANCIAL   MANAGEMENT
Personnel Program
  Highlights of the Commission's personnel management program
in fiscal 1970 included (1) adoption of a personnel management
evaluation system, (2) continued emphasis on employee training, (3)
the granting of the first SEC "Equal Employment Opportunity
Award," and (4) the transfer of its occupational health function to
the Public Health Service.
  The President requested that there be established in each agency a
system to review periodically the effectiveness of personnel manage-
ment within the organization. Pursuant to this directive, the Com-
mission adopted such a system on June 15, 1970. A Personnel Man-
agement Evaluation Committee, chaired by the Executive Assistant
to the Chairman, was given responsibility for implementing the sys-
tem by means of surveys or studies which are designed to measure
how effectively the Commission's personnel programs operate in its
various divisions and offices.Reports containing findings and recom-
mendations of the Committee will be submitted to the Chairman.
  Each of the three principal operating divisions of the Commission
in Washington, D.C., namely, the Division of Trading and Markets,
the Division of Corporation Finance, and the Division of Corporate
Regulation, regularly conducts its own training program. Such a
program typically consists of a schedule of lectures and discussions
by senior employees on the Commission's staff experienced in the
particular subjects to be covered. The Division of Trading and Mar-
208            SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

 kets conducted a week-long enforcement seminar in :May 1970. The
 Division of Corporate Regulation conducted a training program
 after hours during the spring of 1970, primarily for its newer em-
 ployees, dealing with the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Di-
 vision of Corporation Finance held weekly sessions for its new em-
ployees on the examination of registration statements and other
filings under the reporting and disclosure provisions of the Securi-
ties Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
   The Commission's first Equal Employment Opportunity Award
was presented to its Washington, D.C., Regional Administrator, Al-
exander J. Brown, Jr., "for outstanding service as SEC coordinator
of a symposium on the Federal securities laws, sponsored by the
Howard University School of Law, in cooperation with the Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission, during February through May 1970,
for interested students attending Washington Metropolitan Area law
schools." The program involved an ll-week series of evening lectures
providing a broad overview of SEC functions and responsibilities in
which members of the Commission's staff served as the "faculty." A
group of 250 law students enrolled for the sessions, and 120 received
certificates for regular attendance.
   The program has considerable potential for law school curriculum
development as evidenced by observations of the Curriculum Com-
mittee of Howard Law School contained in an evaluation report, as
follows:
      "The need for developing expertise in the ever growing fields of law
   makes it difficult to perform the essential task of developing basic cogni-
   tive legal skills of the law student. If the law school responds to the need
   for developing various expertise by additions or changes in the curriculum,
   it runs the risk of de-emphasizing the development of the basic lawyer
   skills. The solution might very well be in the development of non-credit
   and extra curricular symposia such as this one. In this respect the SEC
   may have made a very profound contribution to legal education."
   Pursuant to the Commission's request, the Public Health Service
 (PHS) conducted a survey of the Commission's occupational health
program. The report submitted by PHS stated, in part, that the
health services offered by the Commission to employees in its Head-
quarters Office in "Tashington were "considerably below the mini-
mum standard" of the Division of Federal Employee Health as well
as of recommendations of the Council on Occupational Health,
American Medical Association. On the basis of the PHS survey re-
port and recommendations, the Commission, in January 1970, au-
thorized the transfer of its Health Unit to the jurisdiction of the
Public Health Service. The transfer of function was effected on

  schedule in April 1970 and Headquarters Office employees are now
  accorded the same level of occupational health services enjoyed by
  the Commission's regional and branch officeemployees.
    As part of the Commission's Fifteenth Annual Service and Merit
  Awards Ceremony held in October 1969, Distinguished Service
  Awards were presented to the following officials of the Commission:

registration of securities issued; (2) qualification of trust inden-
tures; (3) registration of exchanges; (4) brokers and dealers who
are registered with the Commission but who are not members of a
registered national securities association (the National Association
