LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL
SECURITIES .AND EXCHANGECOMMISSION,
Phtladelphta 3, Pa., Aprtl 21, 1945.
Sir
I
I have the honor to transmit to you the Tenth AnnualReport of the Securities and ExchangeCommission~in accordance with the provisions of Section 23 (b) of the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934~approved June 6~ 1934~Section 23 of the Public utility Holding CompanyAct of 1935, approved August 26~ 1935, Section 46 (a) of the Investment CompanyAct of 1940, approved August 22~ 1940 and Section 216 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940~ approved August 22 1940.
In addition to reviewing the principal developments of the past fiscal year~ the report includes a ten-year survey of the Commission'swork. This sw'vey sets forth the results of the Commission'soperations under the vari- ous statutes committedto its charge. At the end of a decade it seemedmost desirable that the Commissionshould render to the Congress such an account of its activities. Because of space limitations no attempt has been madeto detail the entire development of practices and policies as refiected in our orders rules and regulations as they have becomeestablished and exist today. Since this course has been followed in the hi-storical exposition contained in the report~ I think it only proper to point out that the survey is one of results and not one of step-by-step development. In reading these pages one should bear in mindthat they do not describe all of the difficulties which have been encountered or all of the problems which remain unsolved. While I do not wish to minim;ze the iJIIportanceof the results obtained during the ten years of operation under these statutes, I should not like to give the impression that no mistakes have been made. Wherethey have been made, we have endeavored not to repeat them.
Let meassure you that the Commissionwill continue to review the steps already taken and~.in dealing with newproblems as they arise, will exert f1Veryeffort to reach sound conclusions and results and perfect its administration of the tasks Congress has assigned to it.
Respectfully,
Ganson PurceLl., Chainaan.
THE p~mENT OF THE SENATE~ THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES~

This latter sanction against practically all persons concernedin the distribution of a security is one of the concerted most important effort on of the implementsin part of all carrying concerned out to the provide policy full of and the fair Act, disclosure since it results of the

________________

It has been urged that the proposedamendmentto broaden the exemptionpermitted by' section 3 (b) will be helpful to small businesses that seek financing through public offerings of securities and for that reason the Commissionhas concludedthat it merits a trial. Yet the Commission'srecords of the cost of
smaJ.l
flotations of issues indicate that the major
part
of such costs is compensationto underwriters and distributors, and only a relatively small part is represented by other expenses, :inCludingthose affected by registration requirements. This wouldseemto indicate that the registration requirements of the Securities Act have very little to do nth the high flotation costs of small issues.
Statistics showingthe flotation costs of equity security issues of small companiesduring the period from January 1, 1938 to June 30, 1944are presented in AppendixTable 2. There are included all commonand preferred issues filed separately for primary distribution
by
companies haviDg less than five million dollars of assets, other than issues of investment trusts and extractive industry companies. The &&ysis showsthat the total flotation costs of equity issues of companiesreporting less than onem:i.ll:i.ondollars of assets amountedto 21.6 percent of the expected gross proceeds, which included 19.7 percent as compensationto underwriters and dealers and 1.9 percent for other expenses. Comparablefigures for the companiesreporting assets of betweenone

miShIiiiton n SUChefforts to evade the statute are due usually to 'ETieinherent unaoundness of the securities sold. In the case of the sale of tung tree land, for instance, it was
shown that the acreage being sold was not suitable for such production.
The Commission, of course, does not take the position that an ordinary sale of real or personal property involves the sale of a security. But where a purchaser has no intention of assuming any control of the property purchased, but is really bulying o~ an interest in a business enterprise and looks solely to the efforts of the promoter to earn a profit for him, the courts have sustained the Commission's position that the substance controls the fonn and that there is involved the sale of a security and in the use of misrepresentations and fraudulent schemes an injunction should be issued, As the SUpremeCourt recent~ said in the Joiner eaaes

In several cases the courts have defined the statutory term sale of a security to include the stamping by a COJl!P8Di1 of securities previously issued by it a legend reciting an agreement of the holders to an extension of maturity (S.E.C. v; Associated Gas & Electric Co., 24 service F.

While the securities Act contains a mnnber of provisions exempting various types of secu- rities and securities transactions !"romthe registration provisions of the Act, only a few of these exemptions have been considered by the courts. Perhaps the most important of the cases dealing lIith this probl8lll in S.E.C. v. SunbeamGold Kines Co., 95 F. (2d) 699 (C.C.A. 9, 1938).

Considerable litigation has arisen !"romre:t'u.sals to appear in response to Commission's subpoenas. In such situations, applications are made to the appropriate United states Court for enforcement. The subpoenaing of witnesses and documentary evidence in the course of in- vestigations the most part instituted by the COIIIIIission by the Caumission for the purpose has resulted of obtaining in nearly judicial 50 legal enforcement actions brought for of the sub- poenas and in a few cases against the Commissionfor the purpose of enjoining enforcement of the subpoenas. The Jones case discussed above was actually a suit by the Commissionto obtain judicial enforcementOl'"'i subpoena requiring Jones to appear and testi1'y in the Commission's stop order hearing. Jones' challenge of the constitutionality of the registration and in- vestigation provisions of the 5ecur:ities Act was rejected by the NewYork District Court and by the Second Circuit, which upheld the CCDIIIissionlsright to obtain judicial en:forcellmlt of the subpoena in that case.

issued on October 15, 1942. The enforcemen't of that subpoena disclosed a hitherto unknown rela'tionship between Penfield and Bourbon Sales. The Commission fcnmd'that Penfield had been acting as agent for the Bourbon Sal.es Corporation in sel.llng bo't1iJ.ing contracts through the mails 'to persons to whomBourbon Sal.es or PenfieJ.d had previously sold whiskey warehouse receipts and that Penfield had subsequently sold i'ts own bot'tl1ng contracts through the mails in exchange for such receipts. The Commission also 1earned .for 'the first time 'that stock of Penfield was being so1d to the public through 'the mails in exchange for bottling .con- tracts previously issued either by Penfie1d or Bourbon Sales. On April S, 1943, the CClIIIDission expanded i'ts investigation to name the Penfield C~ and 'to cover the sale of Penfield stock. On April 9, 1943, a duJ:y authorized officer of the Commission served a subpoena dnces 'tecum upon one of Penfield's official.s requiring the produc'tion of specified i'tems conta:rnea in NIiHe1d

The district court issued an order enforcing the subpoena on June 1, 1943.

The authority to issue rules on the use of credit in securities transactions is lodged in the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but the adrn1nistration of the rules and all pro- visions of the Act is vested in the Commission. The following is a rmri.8trof the major phases of the COJIIIlIi.ssion's administration of the Act.
REGULATION OF EXCHANGES AND EXCHANGE TRADING
Registration of Exchanges
Section 5 of the Securities ExchangeAct of 19,34requires that all exchanges in the United States either register with the CODIIIIissionor obtain exemptiontrom such registration. Accord- ingly, the Commission'sfirst task under the Act was to set up the machineryfor registering securities exchanges and for handl :fng applications for exemption.
Pursuant to the Act, 28 exchanges have filed applications for registration as national certain filed securities by exchanges, trial exchanges, exami.nersbefore iIwestigators practically whQlll were all hearings of sent them into were filing the held. field in 1934. to In connection examine Before them, granting with and these registration reports applications

Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Continental Can Company,submitted a report to the exchange on January 'Z7, 1938. Thereport recognized the fact that national securities exchanges are public institutions, and it provided a plan for a modernadministrative organization.
Six weeks later, Richard Whitney & Companywas suspended for insolvency. The facts regard- ing the admj n1stration of the NewYork Stock Exchange which were disclosed as an aftermath of the insolvency emphasized the pressing need for a thorough reorganization of exchange affairs; this ease is discussed morefully below. OnMay16, 1938, a radically revised constitution was adopted and a newly elected administration assumed office. The first paid president of the exchange, as provided for in the revised constitution, was elected on June 30, 1938.
This reorganization provided for direct representation of the public on the Board of Governors and increased the representation of exchange firms doing business with the public. It greatly simplified the administrative structure, reducing the numberof standing committees from 17 to 7. It created a paid president, whomust be a nonmembe:r,and executive staffs were created to carry out functions formerly conducted by the Governors sitting as committee members.
The NewYork stock Exchange's constitution was amendedon January 1, 1939, to classify as "allied members
ll
all general partners of memberfirms whodo not individually hold seats on the exchange. This resulted in an extension of the exchange's direct disciplinary powers to such partnet:s.
The Chicago stock Exchange effected a revision of its constitution in 1938, and the Detroit Stock Exchange materially amendedits constitution and rules in the sameyear following in various respects the revision undertaken by the NewYork Stock Exchange.
Effective February 23, 1939, the NewYork Curb Exchange adopted a plan of reorganization, following special committee reports and conferences with officials of this Commission. This reorganization reclassified the constituency of th~ Board and altered the nominating procedure 60
as to give a more equitable representation to membersand partners of memberfirms doing business directly with the public, to out-of-town firms, and to the public itself. This plan, too, provided for three governors not identified with exchange membersto sit as representatives of the general public.
The fact that a thorough revision of exchange administration had been long overdue was illustrated not only by the Whitney cag'e, which involved the NewYork Stock F.xcbange, but also by the so-called Cuppia case, involving the NewYork Curb Exchange. In the latter case, the COJIIIII1ssionreviewed disciplinary proceedings of the NewYork Curb Exchangewith respect to violations of the exchange's ruJ.es by various of its members, including J. Chester Cuppia. 2/ Cuppia, a leading memberof the NewYorkCurb Exchangeand active in the exchange government, had for a long period violated an important provision of the exchange constitution prohibiting the splitting of commissions. For eight years, Cuppia pursued the demoralizing practice of soliciting floor brokers, whomhe was in a position to favor with a share of his firm's ex- tensive business, for rebates of their commission.
The practice was not confined to one or two floor brokers but was pursued on an extensive scale and went unchecked until a falling out between Cuppia and one of the brokers led to litigation. It was only then that the NewYorkCurb Exchange's Business Conduct Committee undertook to investigate the practice. Theinvestigation took place in 1940, after the New York Curb Exchange had determined to reorganize but before the reorganization was completed.
Although .cuppia and his associates were found guilty of the charge of coJlllllissionsplitting~ the punishments provided by the constitution for such an offense were not invoked. Cuppia was permitted to sell his seat and resign from the exchange. Punishment of his associates was confined to a private reprimand.
In the course of the Businness Conduct COJIIII1ttee' s investigat1on~ various membersmade deliberate and proven falsifications to the COJIIIII1.ttee,an offense punishable by suspension or expulsion. Again, punishment was confined to private reprimand.

In the last four months prior to his 8U8pen8ion, Whitney's need for funds to cover cOlllDl1t- ments was so great and so continuous that he negotiated ill loans aggregating $27,361,500. In addition to borrowing from commercial banks, he borrowed from exchange members, memberfirms and partners of memberfirms on at least 42 occasions. On at least 21 occasions, he madefutile efforts to negotiate loans from individuals or firllls connected with the exchange.
Manypersons highly placed in the exchange administration, including a former president, were mrare of Whitney's financial difficulties for a considerable t1me before his suspension. TIro partners of J. P. Morgan & Companywere also aware of Whitney's embezzlement of Gratuity Fund to the securities. exchange authorities.
Adhering to !tI
an UDIIJ'itten code of silence, none of them reported his knowledge
These circumstances, coupled with the fact that no disciplinary action was taken by the New York stock Exchange against RlA;baJ:d Whitney until :March 1938, made it apparent that there should be a reconsideration of the adequacy of the then existing machinery of the exchange for the supervision and surveillance of its members. The COIIIIIissionand the nn Jllanagementof the exchange jointly considered the entire problem. Round-table conferences were held by ol'fic1als of the Conmd.ssionwith officers and representatives of the NewYork Stock Exchange, and certain other representatives of that exchange. These conferences, begun in June 1938, were continued at frequent intervals during the 8UDIIIElrand l'all. Although the statutory powers of the CODIIII1s- sion were also reexamined in the light of the Whitney case, the discussions primarily emphasized the need of the exchange to be more vigorous in the enforcement of its own rules and the regula- tion of its members.
The Board of Governors of the NewYork Stock Exchange approved on October 26, 1938, a program of proposed 1mDediate to permit reforms memberfirms which had been 01' the drafted exchange in cooperation to organize with this Commission. This program
"affiliated companies" which would carry on dealer and underwriting activities separately trom brokerage activities, in order to reduce the risk to customers inherent in the combination of brokerage and underwriting business in the same organization. The program also provided for more frequent filings by members..Jdth the exchange of financial state_,nts and for an annnal audit by independent accountants of all memberfirms doing business with the publiC.

The program provided also that the exchange was to undertake to study the feasibility of a central securities depository which the President of the exchange had then anticipated could serve as the first step toward the ultimate formation of a "Central Trust Institution."

Somemonths later, the President of the exchange appointed a cOJlllllitteeof non-members to study the broad problem of adequate financial protection to customers, and particularly the question of the feasibility of a "Central Trust Institution."

to
the question whe'ther present conditions in the securities markets require that additional steps be taken to protect customers' funds and equities in the hands of brokers and dealers who are also engaged in underwriting or day-by-day trading for their own account.
The Whitney case gave rise to a suit by former customers of Richard Whitney & Company against the New York Stock Exchange to recover damages allegedly sustained as a result of the exchange's failure to enforce its rules governing the conduct of its members. 6/ The Commission filed an amj.cus curiae brief in that case, taking no position on the facts but pointine out that the New York Stock Exchange, as a national securities exchange, is under a duty to enforce its own rules, that civil liability may exist as a result of the breach of a statutory duty even if the right is to of protect such action investors is not not specifically only against granted abuses in under security the Act, market and transactions that the purpose but also of the against

Not content
with
the adequacy of the measures adopted by the exchanges for the protection of customers' securities, the Commission promulgated two rules in November 1940, Rules X-8C-l 7/ and X-15C2-1 under the Securities Exchange Act, governing the pledging of customers' securities; dealers the speculating two from rules or risking are underwriting substantially their customers' ventures. identical. securIties First, 8/ Generally brokers as collateral and speaking, dealers to are the finance forbidden rules their prohibit own to commingle trading,

It was the consensus of everyone who worked on ,the subject that the most feasible way to get a uniform statement would be for the Commission to promulgate a rule and adopt a form which others might adopt. After extended conferences with representatives of all the interested bodies, a form was agreed upon and is now in use.

that the spec1al1st should not hold puts, calls or other options in any security in which he is registered as a specialiat. S1m:1larrules were proposed to govern the conduct of odd-lot dealers.
All national. securities exchangesadopted the rules either in their entirety, as recQIl- mended,or in a formJDod1fiedto meet the individual trading practice of someof the exchanges.
Short selling
Problemsrelating to short selling received particular attention from the COSIIIII1.ss1onafter its organization in 1934. It was not until the sharp drop in stock prices in the fall of 1937, however, that an opportunity was afforded to study at first hand the elfects of short selliDg in a rapidJ,;ydeclining market. Thestudy madeat that time included a detailed analysis of transactions in twenty selected stocks traded on the NewYorkStock Exchangeduring two separate periods in Septemberand October 19'Yl.
Asa result of this studY',the Commissionissued Rules I-lOA-I, I-lOA-2,
and
1-3B-3, effective Februar;y8, 1938. Theeffect of these rules was to prohibit any short sale of a security except at a price abovethe last preceding sale price. Odd-lot transactions
and certain round-lot transactions of odd-lot dealers were exemptedfr<lmthe rules. On February 10, the 1938, purpose the of Commissionexemptedcertain equalizing prices betweenthat short exchange sales on and a .another domestic national u:change securities effected for ex- change.
On
April 8, 1938, certain short sales effected in arbitrage transactions between securities were exempted.
In order to check the adequacy-and effectiveness of these rules, the COIIIIIIissionconducted another detailed study of the trading in the

~pecial Offering P1aDs
Prior to the enactment of the 5ecur1ties ExchangeAct of 1934distributions to the pu.blic of' large b10cks of stocks which were listed on exchanges were frequently- accompaniedby a man1palation of the market. The object of such JD8l1ipnlationwould be two-fold-to raise the price of the security
and
to stbmlate activity to the point where a demandwould be created large enough to a1lowr the sale of the offered security. Af'ter passage of the Act, a method waa developed and widely used whereby-

On February 6, 1942, the Commissionamendedits Rule X-IOB-2to permit special offerings of blocks of securities on national securities exchanges where such offerings are effected pursuant to a plan filed with and declared effective by the Commission. Brieny, these plans provide that a special offering may be madewhenit has been determined that the auction market on the floor of the exchange cannot absorb a particular block of a security within a reasonable time without undue disturbance to the current price. The offering is madeat a fixed price which is set within the frameworkof the existing auction market. Membersacting as brokers for public buyers are paid a special commissionby the seller which ordinarily exceeds the regular commis- sion. Buyers obtain the securities without paying any commission. Full disclosure is madeto the buyer of all of the details relating to his purchase, including the commissionpaid to his broker by the seller.
14, 1942, Pursuant a to plan the terms of the submitted by the exemption, the Commissiondeclared NewYork Stock Exchange. Similar effective as of February
action was taken subse- quently with respect to plans of six other exchanges. These plans varied in minor respects from one another and from the NewYorkStock Exchangeplan. The plans of the San Francisco Stock Exchange, NewYork Curb Exchange, Philadelphia Stock Chicago Stock Exchange, and Cincinnati Stock Exchange were Exchange, declared effective Detroit Stock to that Exchange,
order. Several exchanges have since amendedtheir original plans in the light of experience.
The first special offering was effected on the NewYork Stock Exchange on February 19, 1942. Since that time, through June .30, 1944, a total of 182 offerings have been effected
OR- that exchange involving 2,325,582 shares at a value of $68,406,000. During the sameperiod a total of 23 special offerings have been effected on the other exchanges having plans. These ofrerings involved l4l,253 shares having a value or $2,019,000.
In the year ended June 30, 1944, special offerings were erfected on only four of the seven exchanges with special offering plans, the number of such offerings totaling 80. Data with respect to these offerings appear in Appendix Table 6.
The "Multiple Trading Case"
Section 19 (b) of the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934 empowersthe Commissionunder cer- tain conditions to alter or supplement the rules of an exchange in respect of certain matters, if the exchange itself refuses to makesuch changes. The only proceeding under this section was instituted on January 2, 1941. In this case, the Commissionserved notice on the NewYork Stock Exchange of a hearing on the so-called "multiple trading rule" of that exchange.
Over the years, various regional exchanges had developed so-called "multiple trading" methods for effecting transactions upon their noors in securities which also were traded on the NewYorkStock Exchange. Bythese methods, the prices established on the floors of the regional exchange are determined by the prices on the floor of the NewYorkStock Exchangeas reported upon the ticker of the latter exchange. In this connection, various membersof the NewYork Stock Exchangewhoalso are membersof the regional exchanges have undertaken to participate in "multiple trading" by setting themselves up as odd-lot dealers or specialists on the regional exchange noors in the issues in which such trading is effected. by interpretation of Section 8 of Article XVIof its constitution,

One
of the outstanding cases in which the Commissionsought an injunction to restrain persons fromviolating various provisions of the Securities Exchange Act involved the dealings of the firm of Torr & Co. in the stock of the Translux Daylight Picture Screen Corp. listed on the NewYork CUrb Exchange.

Although the Securities Exclumge Act contains a general prohibition against manipulation, it does not prohibit certam lc:iJlds of manipulation.

section 15 (d) of the securities Exchange Act
It 1dll be recalled that Section 15
or
the securities ExchangeAct of 1934 as origina1ly enacted speci.f:l.cally author:lsed the CClIlIDi8sionto adopt rules and regulations p1'OV1ding for the registration of securities for which over-the-counter dealers madeor created. market. I..l:though the COIIIDi.ssionrecognized from the beginning that registration of over-the-counter securiti.es
Wjl8
•
extremely desirable, i.t rea1iZed that such registration involved vastly greater difficulties than the registration of ove:t-the-eounter brokers and dealers.
This problem was discussed at length by the UDlisted securities upon Exchanges
ll
,
transmitted CClllllissionin to Congress on its January "Report 3, 1936, on Trading pursuant; in
to Section 12 (f) of the securities ExchangeAct of 19)4. In that report a J1UIIber of suggestions were considered for achieving the registration of' securities which were traded exclusively in the OV8:t-the-eoUIIliermarket as well as those whichwere admitted to unlisted trading privileges upon certain national securities exchanges. The COJIIIIissiondid not rec<:JllDlend any of these suggestions as the solution f'or the problem. It presented them to Congress in the hope that both public by discussion Congress and thereof the COlIlIIIission,more would make judgDent certain. as to Following the desirability the
JMld
of ng the of' various this report suggestions,
Congress adopted one of the suggestions contained therein by enacting Section 15 (d) of' the securities .Exchange,Act of' 1934 which provides in part:
llEachregistration statement hereafter f'i1ed pursuant, to the securities Act of 1933, as amended,shall contain an underta.lrilJg by the issuer of the issUe of securities to 'Which the rules registration and regulations statement as the relates COIIIIIIi88ionmay to file with prescribe the COJIIIIission,in as necessary accordance or appropriate with in
such
the information, public interest documents, or f'or and the reports, protection as may of be investors, required pursuant such supp1eIIIentary to section and 13 of periodic
this titlB in respect of' a security 1:iBted and registered on a national securities exchange; but such UDdertaldng shall becaDe operatiTe only if the aggregate of'feriDg price of' such issue of securities, plus the aggregate value of all other securi"ties of such issuer of the same class (as hereina.ft;er defined) outstanding, canpu.teduponthe basis of such offering price, amountsto $2,000,000 or more."
The provisions of' this section have served to make available to investors periodic informa- tion concerning
JII8.Dy
issuers of securities 'Whohave registered under the Securities Act of 1933. lIhi.ch Nevertheless very little there public are JII8IIY information securities is now available dealt in 8IJ3'Wbere. in the DVe:t-the-eountermarket Moreover, there is substantial
concerning
evidence that the DDIIlberas well as the importance of unregistered securities dealt in in the ove:t-tbe-eounter market has increased in recent ~ars. Theproblem of obtaining adequate in- formation on cmn-the-courrt.er securities is being actively considered by the CClIIIIDission.

At the same ~ that it adopted section 15 (d) ~

The Circuit court sustained the Commission'sorder on an independent interpretation ot
the statutes and the ea-1asion's rules. In reaching i1;&conclusion, the Court did not have re- course to the doctrine that the consistent and contemporaneousconstruction of the statute by an administrative body'should control unless plainly erroneous. In its opinion the Court said:
"An ovel'-tbe-eounter firm which activel:y sol1cits customers and then sells them securities at prices as far abovethe market as were those 1Ihich petitioner 1.' i'
charged here JIII18t be deemed to commita fraud. It holds itself

The key to the success of a1.l of peti- tioner's dealings
1IU
the confidence in itself which it managed to instlll in the customers. Once that confidence was established, the failure to reveal the mark- up pocketed
by"
the firm was both an omission to state a material fact and a fraudulent derlce. Whennothing was said about markst price, the natural implica- tion

The Act was passed by Congress a1'ter a thorough study of electric and gas utility and hold- ing ccmpanies conducted by the Federal Trade Commissionfran 1928 to 1934 pursuant to Senate Resolution 83, 70th Congress, United 1Ddustry States that has Senate ever

A brief description of the excessive concentration of control of the utility industry which led to many of the evils aga:1Dst which the Act is directed and the need for financial rehabi.li- tation of maI\V' of the public utility holding ccmpau;ysystems is given in the fo110111ngsections.
Concentration of Control of the Electric and Gas utilities
The electric utility :industry, unlike many other major industries, is essentially local in its operations and markets. By e:xisting means, power can be transmitted economically for only limited distances. In the manufactured gas industry ectmalic transmission is mach more limited. Consequently, there are no operating economies in the organization of these industries on a national scale. Regional groupings on an integrated basis correspond to the ecancmic needs ent state o':f such of the public arts. uti11.tiee These are and the appear find1ngs to be o£ the Congress appropriate in Sections OImerShip 1, pattern in 10 (e), and the 11 pres-

During the period 1920-1930, hc.ever, holding cCllllp8llies, irreapective of econCDic or f'oDcticmal. rel..ation to other properties in the system, acquired utility properties all over the country' in order to bni.ld extensive utility empires.

orders, and in Section II (e), which permits the filing of voluntary p'Lana for compliancewith the standards of Section II (b). Toa ~
large extent, Section ll'results in the HoldingCom- P8D1'Act being self-liquidating, for, as utility companiesare freed fromholding companycan- trol, the Commissiongenerallly loses jurisdiction over themunder this Act.
The problem of conformingthe electric and gas utility holding companiesto the requirements of Section II (b) is a task of great magnitude. Progress under Section II wasslow in getting underway. Althoughthe statute was enacted
by
Congt"essin August1935, the Cormnissionwas directed to enforce the integt"ation and simplification provisions only ". • • as soon as prac- ticable after January I, 1938." In the intervening period holding companieswere given an oppor- tunity to take voluntary steps to complywith Section ll. However,the companiesdid not avail themselves of that opportunity but chose instead to test the constitutionality of the Act. After the decision of the SupremeCourt in Ilarch 1938upholding the constitutionality of the registrar- tion provisions, the COIIIIIliss.1on gave all holding companiesa further opportunity to ~t to the COIIlIII:issiontheir plans for voluntary compliance. Theyrespondedto the Commissi-on'sinvitar- tion
by
submitting tentative plans which on examination were clearly impractical and not in conformitywith the statute. In general their plans amountedto little moret..hanattempts to justify the retention of existing scattered holdings.
It thus becameclear to the Commissionthat compliancewith the Act could be achieved only by the institution of affirmative proceedings, pursuant to the statutory direction in Section II (b). Accordinglyin the spring of 1940, the Canmissioninstituted integt"ation proceedings with respect to nine major utility helding companysystems and corporate simplification pro- ceedings nth respect to three major systems. Thetwo classefl of proceedings are interrelated, since simplification, action taken and to steps cauply taken nth in the the geogt"aphicalstandards direction of corporate mayalso simplification
.facilitate may
~
corporate serve to eliminate substantial problemswhich would otherwise require determination in proceedings under Section II (b) (i),
Onceproceedings under Section II are instituted by the COIIIIIlission(or are initiated by the filing of a volUD'haryplan), full hearings are held in which all interested parties are given the opportunity to present evidence andvoice their views be.fore the COIIIIlission.On the basis of the record before it
and
the contentions madeas to the applicability of the la1r to the facts, the Comission issues its findings and opinion and order. All such orders are subject to .f'ul1 judicial review in the federal courts.
TheCCllllllission's decisions to date under Section II (b) have clarified most of the im- portant Corporation electric interpretative ut1t1ty 87

The tabulation includes 14 holding companies and shows that 11 of these companieshave 229 utility or non-utility subsidiaries with total assets of approximately $3,946,000,000.
The
Carrying Out of Section 11 Orders
Section 11 (c) provides that all orders o:r the Commissionunder Section complied with lfithin one year except that an additional year maybe obtained 11 (b) upon a should showing be
o:r due diligence. If tJ1e companydoes not voluntarily complywith the order, the Commissionis empoweredunder Section 11 (d) to seelethe aid of a United States District Court to enforce the order. UnderSection 11 (d) the Court maytake jurisdiction
and
possession of the companyand its assets, may appoint a trustee, and mayenforce a plan to meet the Section 11 (b) order, 1!' the plan has been approved
by
the Commission.
It was Congroesstintention, however, to encourage the various" holding companysystems to complywith the Act voluntarily. For this reason Section 11 (e) provides that a companymay :rile a voluntary plan with the Commission,that a public necessary hearing to effectuate in which Section
investors llr
(b) are and encouraged fair the Commissionshall to voice their views, approve i:r the the plan plan, is after
found and equitable to the affected persons, and that on the request of the compa!JYthe Commission
may
seek enforcement of the plan in the courts. The courts are required to enforce section tuate Section 11 (b). and fair SlIdequitable. 11 (e) Thus, plans security if they holders are found have appropriate the protection to effec-
o:r findings as to the fairness and equity of plans by both the COIIIIIIissionand a United States Dis- trict Court.
llany plans for complete or partial compliance 1I1th Section 11 have already been approved by
the COII'IDdssionand have been or are being
CODSUJIIIIated.
Ya1:Jy JDQresystems have fUed plans which are currently being considered by the C<DD1ssion,and a number of other holding companies are discussing with the CCIIIII1ssion'sstaff drafts of plans which they have prepared. The fU- ing, approval, and consummationof these plans represent major achievements in the financial and operating reorganization of 'the American utility industry.
The Protection of the Rights of Security Holders in section 11 (e) Blans
Voluntary caopliance nth Section 11 (b) does not mean, as the alarm1.sts once contended, dumpingor forced sales of securities on the markets. There has not been a single instance of "dumping" of securities upon a market unable to
pa;T
a fair price for them in the entire hiStory of enforcement of the Act. Indeed, in man;y instances the sales have resulted in sub- stantial profits. In addition to sales, other 8~

As has been said, security holders are not required to accept Section 11 (e) plans unless they are f'omxi fair determining whether and equitable by both the Oommissionand a United States District plans -are fair and equitable the Commissionhas sought to entorce Court. the intent In
of Congress that Section 11 should not have the effect of destroying values for arry security holder;, that it should not cause any portion of the legitimate investment interest of any secu- rity holder to be given to another. Two principal types of cases in which this problem has been before the Commissionare those involving the relative rights of preferred and caumon.stock- holders and those involving bond or debenture holders whose securities are redeemable at the option of the company.
In the first type of case" the COIImIiss1onhas held that where a cClllpanyis being reorganized or liquidated under Section 11" fairness and equity require that the commonstock be permitted to participate :in the reorganization where it has a legitimate investment interest in the holding cOllllpaay,and but for the necessity of 1dnd1ng up the compan;yunder Section 11, it lrOU1d be in a position to receive earnings in the future.

The "Deep Rock- Principle
In the -Deep Rock" case,
W
the SUPreJ!18Court held that under the circumstances there present, a parent corporation could not participate on the samebasis as the public security holders in a reorganization of a subsidiary, and that the parent
I
s debt c1aims IIII18t be sub- ordinated to the publicly-held preferred stock of the subsidiary. Oneof the principles derived fram the decision is that this restriction or subordination appli.es where a parent is guilty of mismanagementor unfair treatment of the subsidiary. As a principle of equity this is simple of statement, but in practice it has been found that each case where the issue arises presents a caoplicated set of facts requiring careful analysis. Since one of the cardinal. abuses which led to the pasaage of the Holding CompanyAct was overreaching by holding companies in their dealings nth their subsidiaries, the CClIIIIIIissiOllexamines every situation with care to ensure that the public security holders 1dll be protected.
In man;y situations, plans filed by Cc:a:paD1esunder Section 11 have given recognition to this principle. For example, Empire Gas and Foel CC8Jl8DYwhich was being recapitalized under the Act, had outstanding a large amount of preferred stock in the hands of the pIlbllc. It was indebted to its parent, Cities Service Company,in the SIBOmltof more than $100,000,000. Empire had been incorporated dividends bad by been Cities Paid in on 1912 the preferred and had been stock cOIlt.inuously for more than dCllinated ten years and although controlled interest by it. No
had been paid regularly on the debt OW'ed to the parent. The history of the intercorporate relationships between Cities and Empire raised serious doubts as to the validty and proper rank of the huge debt claim of Cities. After consultation with the C~ssion's staff, Cities agreed to a plan whereby the pIlblic Preferred stockholders of Ellpire received new debentures of Empire in an amount equal to the par value of the preferred stock plus accumulated unpaid dividends, and Cities' $100,000,000 of intercompany debt c1abls against Empirewere made junior to those new debentures. 26/
It is noteworthy that although the market price
or
the preferred stock o.fEmpire was $57.50 per share the day before the proceedings were CaDllletJCed, the preferred stockholder could have sold the new debenture he received for $157.00 ilIIaediately after the plan was put into effect.
Elimination of Inequitable Distribution of Voting Ponr
An important effect of Section 11 (b) on operating companies is the requirement that neces- sary steps shall be taken to ensure that the corporate structure of an operating companydoes not involve an inequitable distribution of voting power amongits security holders. One of the significant evils against which the Act was directed, was control over operating caopanies by holding pany. companies which Frequently in had holding a companysystems disproportionately an undue smal1 portion equity investment in the operating com-
of the capital of the operating utility caopanies was raised by selling bonds and preferred stock to the public and the holding companypaid little or nothing for the
COlllllOn
stock which had voting control.
In considering what steps should be required to cure situations of that kind, and in passing on voluntary plans designed to bring operating coapanies into conformity with Section 11 (b) (2), the Commissionhas been faced with the problem whether the inequitable distribution of voting power might not be cured simply by giving voting control to the preferred stockholders or bond- holders of the operating companyand leaving the security structure otherwise untouched. After careful consideration, the Commissiondetermined that half measures of that type would not solve the problem, for such plans would not be feasible. Over-eapitalized operating caopanies which are so top-heavy with senior securities that it is inequitable for the camnanstockholder to have control, have structures which impede the raising of new capital, and obstruct regulation. Fur- thermore, it is f1nanciall~ unsound to have a campanycontrolled by a senior security with a limited dividend cla.:1Ja,for then the more jlmior securities would be pmrerless to protect them- selves. The COIIIIII1.ssiondetermined that when an inequitable distribution of voting power is

In both holding companiesand operating compan- ies" there are many instances wherethe effectuation of plans of corporate simplification to complywith Section 11 (b) has permitted the now of dividends to investors whohave not re- ceived any incomefor "!IaIlY years. In manyother cases holding companieshave retired their senior securities by cash payments. Pursuant to the requirements of Section 11 (b) (1) many holding companieshave been reducing the scope of thei.r operations" thus reducing a concentra- tion of economicpowerwhich" as Congressfound" had reached dangerousproportions.
In all of these situations investors have been fully protected. Thus, before Southern ColoradoPowerCompaRY"an operating subsidiary of Standard Gas and Electric Company"filed its recapitalization plan with the COlIUIlission"its preferred stock wasselling at $32per share; after the Commissionapprovedthe plan the stock was selling at $60 per share and by the time the District Court's order wasentered also approvingthe plan anddirecting its enforcement" the stock wasselling at $70a share. TheUnited Gas ImprovementCompany"a registered holding company"divested itself of its holdings in Philadelphia Electric Companyand Public Service Corporation of NewJersey (whichcompanieshave combinedassets of $1,,200,,000,,000)by distribut- ing these holdings plus cash to U.G.I.'s own preferred and commonstockholders. Just before the plan wasfiled" the market price of U.G.I. commonstock was about $4 per share although as in the case of most other holding companystocks the break-up value of the shares was substantial ly greater than that amount. Since the plan proposedto eliminate a large portion of this discount by transferring direct ownershipof certain of these investments of U.G.I.'s commonstock- holders" the commonrose to $6per share immediatelyafter the plan wasfiled and just before the distribution of the securities to stockholders the commonstock sold at $9-7/8 per share. Jlanyinstances of similar benefit to investors as a result of the enforcementof Section 11 are available in the COlIUIlission'sfiles.
Investment analysts such as Standard and Poor's have long pointed out that "there seems little justification for any fear that holding companieswill be forced to dispose of properties at inadequate prices or to take any action that would adversely affect true values." Standard andPoor's" Moody'sStockSurveyandBarron's frequently publish studies showingthat holding companysecurities sell at substantial discounts ontheir liquidating values. In its publica- tion "TheOutlook"for June 7" 1943"Standard and Poor's state:
"HoldingCompanystocks have bemf1ted fromintegration or liquidation plans filed with the SECin recent months••• Since utility holding companystocks normally sell at a discount fromtheir liquidating value (just as do investment trust equities) the filing of liquidation plans has caused the price of securities involved to advance sharply to approximatelythose values.
"This was the experience of the commonstocks of Federal Water and Gas"National Power& Light" Niagara HudsonPowerand United Gas Improvement"all of which have lately filed integration plans" as well as the preferred stocks of Standard GaB & Electric and United Light & Power. Many of these issues morethan doubledin price with the announce- mentthat liquidation or integration of the holding companywasplanned • •• Additional utility halding companieswill probably file integration or liquidation plans" which should prove beneficial generally to the marketprice of their securities."
Similar expressions concerning the beneficial effects of Section 11 have been madeby a number of holding companymanagements.

Since, by and large, the utility in- dustry has been characterized by an excessive Bm01Ultof debt and other senior securities, the Commission'sregulatory efforts under Sections 6 (b) and 7 have been in considerable part de- voted to reduction of these senior securities and the increase of the cammonstock equity. In someinstances, conditions have been attached requiring that the interest savings fram re- funding or a certain amountof net earnings be reserved to redeemoutstaniing debt. In other instances, the Commissionhas required the inclusion of sinking fund provisions wherebythe issuer agrees to devote annually a stated amountto retirement of bonds or to property addi- tions. In still other instances, the objective of debt reduction has been achieved by financ- ing through the issuance of securities nth short-term serial maturities.

enter-
statement or overstatement of depreciation distorts net operating incomeand gives a misleading picture of the financial condition of the enterprise; investors are given an illusory and false impression with regard to earnings coverage, earned surplus and the depreciation reserve.
Prior to the adoption of revised systems of accounts for electric and gas utilities in 1937,whichprovide specifically for depreciation accounting, the retirement-reserve methodof accounting for property retirements wasin general use in the electric and gas utility industry with the sanction of most of the regulatory agencies having jurisdiction. Whilea sounduse of the retirement-reserve methoddid not preclude adequate accruals and did not, of course, alter the fundamentalnature of depreciation, many companiescharged amountssufficient to provide for only a little morethan current property retirements and did not take into account the depreciation currently accruing onthe property whichcontinued in service. That practice was not only inherently deceptive but, because of the growingneedfor capital, it resulted in the issuance and sale of a considerably larger volumeof securities than otherwise wouldhave been necessary. It is nowgenerally recognized that adequateprovision for depreciation is essen- tial to the protection of the interest of investors.
To protect new and existing investors against the ill-effects of inadequate depreciation, the Commissionhas insisted uponcertain protective measures.

It should be noted that the increased depreciation requirements like many other restrictions 1mposedin connectd.on with proposed security issues, do not require an actual outfiow of cash. On the contrary, their effect is to increase the amountof cash retained in the business.
BondIndentures
The principal financing mediumof utilities has been the corporate bondsecured by an in- denture of mortgageuponthe plant and property of the obligor. Theready market and 1011' yield of utility bonds are doubtless to be attributed to the security conferred by a modern indenture and to the protective margin of earnings and assets over and abovethe claims of bondholders resulting from an increased commonstock equity.

The experience o£ the depression led to the enactment of the Trust Indenture Act, the primary purpose of which was to require the trustee to assume a more active and responsible function in enforcing the terms of the indenture, and to prevent the designation of a trustee if a connict of interest would result. In addition to applying the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act, it is the practice o£ the Commission,in connection

utility indentures are almost invariably "open-end". Theadditional (equally ranldng) bonds that related mayin to the the additional future be property issued under acquired the indenture, by the obligor. usually Oldindentures unlimited in absolute permitted amount,are the issu- ance of bondsin principal amountequal to 70-80%of the "fair value" of additional property; under current practice as reflected in Commissiondecisions the max:ilnum allowed has been 60%of the cost or fair value, whicheveris less, of net additions to fixed property. Net additions are required to be defined carefully in order to assure, amongother things, that property whichhas been purchasedby funds generated fromdepreciation accruals shall not formthe basis of additional bonds. Theissuance of additional bondsis also conditioned upona conservative interest coverage requirement. Toprevent dilution or dissipation of the pledged property it is, of course, necessary to incorporate adequateprovisions respecting maintenanceanddeprecia- tion, the nature of which has beendescribed above. Sink1ngfund provisions have been generally required, particularly where satisfactory ratios cannot be obtained at the time of the issuance of the securities for whichthe COIIIIIIission'sapproval is sought.

COMPETITIVE BIDDING
On April 7, 1941, the COIIIDlissionadopted Rule U-50, requiring competitive bidding in the sale of securities by registered public ut1lity holding companies and their subsidiaries. The rule, applicable both to new security issues and to the sale by holding companies of portfolio securiti .. , prescribes public invitation of sealed bids. Certain transact10ns are specifically exeapt, including securities sold for less than one million dollars; securities issued pro rata to existing anyliqu1dat1on security holders or reorganization; pursuant to e.ny preemptive and loans of a maturity right ot or privilege ten years or in connection with
or less, where the lender is a tinancial institution not purchasing for resale and no tinder's fee or other negotiation charge is to be paid to any trom cCl8lpetitive bidding by third order person. ot the COIIIIIission.
In addition, there is a general prov1aion tor exemption
Prior to the adoption ot Rule U-50, the customary method ot selling utility securities in- volved a sale by the issuing corporation to an undarwriting SJIldicate at a pr1ce determined by private negotiation with the principal or so-called originating undenrriter. It was an established polic,. of investment bankers not to compete 8IIIOng theJllSe1ves tor the securities business of any issuer which had a continuing investment banldng relationship with a particular firm. Similarl,., with very few exceptions, the issuing corporation made no attempt to seek cOilpetitive bids or to "shop around" tor better terms than those otfered by its customary banker. In

experience with that rule, however, the C~ssion concluded that it was difficult to adm1n1l1ter and was burdenaOlle and costly to issuers and underwriters. AccordiDgl,., in February 1940, the Cc.a1I1s1oninstructed ita Public Utilities Division to make a fllll .tudy of the problem. At the
S8JII8
time a letter was written to each holding cQll})&llYIl7llteIIlsubject to the Act, as well as to State commission, investment bankers and securities dealers throughOllt the country, inviting their suggestions as to the method by which the COIIIIII1s8ionJlight llbest insure the reasonableness of fees and cOllllllissionsand the fairness of the tel'lll8 and cODditions of aD7 proposed issue and sale of utilit,. securities". Many replies were received and were anal1Zed by the Commission's staff. The staff concluded that none of the suggestions received, other than cOlllp8titive bidding, gave promise of meeting the problem effective17.
In December1940 the Public Utilities Division rendered its report to the Comm1ssion fol'llla1l,. recOlllllendingthe adoption of a competitive bidding rule. 40/ Copies of that report were distributed to registered holding companies, state and Federal regliIatory bodies, and to a broad list of investment baDkera and dealers, both direc1;17 and through the Investment Bankers Associa- tion and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. In distributing the report, written cOIIIIIl8ntswere invited, following which numerous responses were received. The Commission then called a public conference to consider the recCllDlendedrule and public discussion continued for four and one-halr da,.s. The conference was attended by approximatel,. 200 persons from every part of the country, including two membersof Congress, investment bankers, securities dealers, and representatives of other governmental agencies. Four membersof the CO!IIIIl1.ssionwere present at all t1Jles. All abades of opinion, pro and ~, were expressed on the question, both in the written responses and at the conferences.
After we1gh1Dgtbe evidence and considering all aspects of the problem, the Commission concluded that there was no ....,. short of competitive bidding that would afford. it satisfactory II88.D8
of determining the fairness of prices, the reasonableness of spreads or assure disinter- ested advice in fiDaDc1al _tters to the companies concerned, and effectivel,. control their dealings with atf1l1atell. 41/
In the three-year period ending June 30, 1944, 59 public utilit,. issues in the aggregate aount of approxiaatel,. $960,000,000 were sold competitively under the procedures specified in Rule U-50. PertiDent information concerning the results of competitive bidding under the Rule is presented each year b,. the Commissionin a report eDtitled "Securi t,. Issues of Electric and Gas Utilities-. 42/ It _,. be noted that except in one or two instances, insurance companies and other institit1ona1 investors have not submitted bids for issues sold pureuant to Rule U-50. It ma,.also be observed that lIince the COJIIIIisB1on'scc.petitive bidding rule became effective there has been a substantial. decrease in the relative aaount of po.blic utilit7 securities that have been privatel,. placed.

The rules and regulations adoptedby the CODIIII1ssionpermitted the continuation of central service, sales and construction contracts provided these were pertoI'llledby a subsidiary of the holding cCllllP8llY'or a mutual service cOlllJl8l1Y',that is onewhich is ownedby the companiesbeing serviced.

The
mak1ng it almost impossible to identify the specific transactions to be performedfor specific systemcompanies. Thecosts of these organizations, generally, werebilled to the systemcom- panies on a percentage of gross revenues or a percentage of const~ction costs.
Withthe experience gained in these early cases it becameincreasingly apparent that a sub- stantial portion of the amountscharged to operating companiesshould be borne by the holding company. The Commission'sproblemthen was one of determining what holding companycosts actually are and requiring that these costs be paid by" the holding companiesand thus eliminated as an item of expense to the operating cOJllpanies. This problempresented difficulties because of the cOlBlll1nglingof holding companyand operating companyactivities in the central organizations.
In a series of proceedings initiated by the Commissionand in connectionwith the considera- tion of cases wbich had been pendingfor sometime, the COJIIIII1ssiondealt with this apparent shifting of ho1d.1ngc~ expensesto the operating companies. In essence the cond!tion con- fronting the COIlIIII1ssionin these cases, in greater or lesser degree and in one form or another, was the use by the holding companyof commonofficers and ellployeesbetweenit and the service companyto supervise in its owninterest the daily operations of the operating companiesand the passing on to those companiesof the _jor portion of the cost of such supervision. The questions at issue werewhether or not it was possible to allocate such expensesbetweenthe holding companyand operating companies"fairly and equitably" pursuant to the requirements of Section 1) (b), and whether, in effect, the holding companywasnot in reality rendering services tor a charge to its operating subsidiaries in contravention of Section 1) (a).
In its opinions with respect to these cases, the Commissionestablished the broad principle that compensationand collateral expenses of all holding companyofficers, directors, and employees must be borne directly by" such holding companiesand could not be shared with their controlled bas activities service taken companiesand 'the ot the position holding thus that company.

TheCOJIIIII1ssionhas taken the position that where a fair, equitable pnd feasible plan of reorganization cannot be effectuated without considering and giving effect to such causes of action, they should properly be asserted as claims in the Com- mission's reorganisation proceeding.

Subsequent to the close of the hearings but prior to a final order of the Commission,the Trustees of Agecoand Agecorp and a subsidiary companyin the Associated system instituted suits 1...'1 both a state court and a federal court, in Massachusetts against Negea. The suit in the state court involved consideration of the status of indebtedness, in the amount of $14,583,2$0, which bad been cancelled in 1930 through the issuance by Negea of equity securities. The suit in the fecieral court involved an accounting for alleged profits received by Negeain, and resulting from, the transfer of certain stock and indebtedness of Electric Associates, Inc. from Agecorp to Negea in 1932.
It appeared to the Commissionthat the subject matter of the suits against Negeawere rglevant to any determination of a proper allocation of securities under any plan of recapitali- zation of Negea. Hence, OnFe1n'u.ary17, 1943, the Ca.dasion instituted further proceedings under various sections of the Act, including Secti~ 11, for the purpose of determining (1) nether, and to ...hat extent, the Trustees of Agecoand Agecorp and its subsidiary had valid ozla.imsagainst Negea, and (2) in the event that any claiJlB ...ere deemedto be valid, the rank or such clai:as in relation to the claims of pnbllely-held securities of Negea. 128/

In February 1940 Central and American, two subsidiaries of Middle West, filed a joint application proposing a consolidation of the two companies. OnDecember5, 1940 the Commission instituted proceedings under Section 11 (b) (2) and ordered that the hearings of the two cases be consolidated. The consolidation issue in the case centered around the question of whether the new corporation should issue any preferred stock. The proponents of the plan submitted by the companies contended that preferred stock was necessary in the newcompanyin order to preserve the priorities of the holders of the prior lien and preferred stocks of Central and the preferred stock of American. The Commissionon June 4, 1942 ruled that the newcorporation could have only cOBlll1onstock. 150/ Therespondents filed a petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for thel5istrict of Columbia, which upheld the COJIDissionin its opinion of June 7, 1943. 151/ effectiiit'ed On August 2, 1943 Central and _r1can through the issuance of a single class ot filed capital an AmendedPlan stock. of merger to be

remaining properties were acquired by The Western Public Service Company,a Delaware corpora- tion (Western, Del.), a newly-formedsubsidiary of Engineers, which also acquired the securities of Western's subsidiaries, The Northern Kansas PowerCompanyand Missouri Service Company. Engineers accepted an order to divest itself' of the properties ownedby Western, Del. and by The Northern Kansas PowerCompanyand Missouri Service Company. On.:ieptember16, 1942 the Commissionordered the divestment of the remaining properties in t he Engineers system except the electric utility properties of Virginia Electric and PowerCompany,allowing Engineers, however, fifteen days within which to petition for leave to retain instead the eleci:.ric utility properties of Gulf States utilities Company.161/ Engineers appealed to the United states Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. 162/
OnNovember22, 1943 the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbiarendered an Opinion upholding the Commission's order in most respects but setting it aside upon the ground that the Commissionbad misinterpreted the so-called "incidental business clause" of Section 11 (b) (1). The Court intimated also that Engineers must be given a further right to designate the principal integrated utility system Whichit desired to retain. Both Engineers and the Commissionfiled petitions for writs of certiorari in the SupremeCourt of the United States. OnJune 5, 1944 the petitions were granted and the matter is nowpending in the SupremeCourt.
Meanwhile, Enginee~ has divested itself' of its interest in Puget SoundPower& Light Com- pany, The KeyWest Electric Company,El Paso Natural Gas Company,El Faso & Juarez Traction Com- pany, Baton RougeBus Company,Inc., and the transportation businesses conducted by El Paso Electric Company(Texas), and Virginia Electric and PowerCompany.

15. The United Corporation
OnJuly 28, 1941, the Commissioninstituted proceedings under Sections II (b) (1) and 11 (b) (2) with respect to The United Corporation, and consolidated such proceedings for hearing with United's Section 11 (e) plan filed in March1941. In its plan, United proposed to reduce its holdings in each of its statutory subsidiaries to less than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities whensuch reduction wouldbe advantageous in the opinion of its management. Pending such reduction, United proposed to refrain from voting the securities without the prior approval of the Commission. Thepredominant portion of United's portfolio comprises the common stocks of four holding companysubsidiaries: TheUnited Gas ImprovementCompany,PUblic Service Corporation of NewJersey, Niagara HudsonPowerCorporation, and ColumbiaGas & Electric Corporation. OnAugust 14, 1943, after extensive hearings, the Commissiondisapproved United's plan, and, pursuant to Section 11 (b) (2), ordered that United change its existing capitalization to one class of stock and cease to be a holding company.163/
OnJune 27, 1944TheUnited Corporation filed a plan pursuant to Section 11 (e) which provided for the exchange of substantially all of its holdings of the commonstocks of PhiladeJ- phia Electric Companyand De1alrare Power & Light Companyplus cash for approximately one-hali of its outstanding preferred stock. 164/ The plan was subsequently amendedto provide for the exchange of only the Philadelphia Electric commonstock and an increased amount of cash. The plan, as amended,was approved by the Commissionon November24, 1944, 165/ and has since been consummated.

As a preliJninary step thereto, Standard Oil caused Consolidated Natural Gas Companyto be organized and to register under the provisions of the Act. Thereafter, on August 12, 1943, Standard Oil also filed notification of registration as a holding company.

Since certain of the holders of such bonds had indicated their intention to appeal fran the CODIIissionand the Court's decision in regard to the non- paYJlBDtof the redempt;ion premiums, Laclede Gas, in order to consummatethe plan while such appeals were pending, amendedthe plan to provide for the deposit in escrow of sufficient funds to pay such prem1UJ11S in the event that it should be ultimately determined that the premiumswere due and payable. By order ~ted December2, 1944, the Commissionapproved the plan as so amended 178/ and on December4, 1944, the Federal Court entered its findings and order approving the plan as so amended.

There is a multitude of diverse questions with 1Ih1.chthe CCllllllissionis concemed as a party to a Chapter Xproceeding. Afetr of the more important _tters which have arisen are discussed in the following paragraphs.

exceptional case and has, in several instances, taken the position that the appointmentof an additional trustee wasunnecessary. TheCamnissionhas also undertaken to prevent the en- croachmentby the additional trustee uponthe functions of the disinterested trustee. For example, the Commissionsuccessfu1.ly objected to the participation by the additional trustee, in in one the preparation case, in the of preparation a plan. Likewise, of the trustee's the Camnission's report under objection Section to 167 an and, order in 1Ihichwould
another case,
have deprived the independent trustee of the powerto participate in the operation of the busi- ness was upheld. Althoughthe additional trustee maybe a memberof the old management,the Commissionhas urged that such appointees be free from interests adverse to the estate. Th18 position was sustained by the Circuit Court of Appealsfor the SecondCircuit in an appeal in lIh1chthe Securities Commissionparticipated Corporation.
?:I
in proceedings for the reorganization of Realty Associates
The Commissionhas at all times urged fUll compliancewith Section 167 (5) of the Act whichrequires the trustee to report to the security holders as to his investigation of the property, liabUities, andfinancial condition of the debtor, the operation of its business and the desirability of the conti.mlancethereof. It only to enable the security holders to make suggestions is felt that such reports for a plan but also are to necessary give themthe not
necessary information for determiniJ::lgthe desirability of accepting proposedplans. The Com- mission
l
s staff has often consulted with trustees uponproblemsarising in connectdon'Withthe preparation of such reports and has been able to provide trustees with information useful in carrying Commissionhas out their duties. For example, been in a position to offer as advice the result to trustees of its E:Xperiencein reorganizations the
and to courts on such matters as the scope of the investigation to be madeby the independent t,:-.lSteesor by accountants hired by them.
The iJIlportaneeof
Co
thorough 1nvestigation by the trustee is manifest and the Commission has called the attention of the trustee, or the court, if' necel:lsary,to any omissions in this respect. For example, in the proceedings for the reorganization of Central States Electric C0alriSationthe ag
t the Commissionurged that former managementbe made. a moredetailed investigation of possi6lS causes of action
Onappeal the Circuit Court of Appealsfor the Fourth Circuit sustained this position.?:/ TheCircuit Court also held that the possibility that statutes of lilIIitations might be pleaded as a defellBeto suite brought by the trustees wasnot sufficient ground for denying the :...:questedinvestigation since an examination might disclose facts whichwouldprevent the rumU.ng of the statutes, suit might be brought in a Federal court of equity whereit 18extremely doubtful that the state statutes wouldbe followed, and, in any event, the statutes might not be pleaded as a defense. TheCourt agreed with the Commission that the investigation ought not to be denied because opposedby a committeeof debenture holders corporation in view which of was the seeking rights of reorganization preferred stockholders; and had a vital they in1;erest too had contributed in recovery capital that to m1ght
the

In another case i.nvolving the pr0vi.8ions of Section 167, the Circuit Court of Appealsfor the Seventh Circuit adopted the views urged by the Commissionand recognized the responsibili- ties of a reorganization trustee to make a thorough examination of the financial worth of an in- dividual 'Whowas a personal guarantor of the debtor's bonds and whoapparently was also indebted directly to the debtor.

ADITISORY REPORTS
Although the preparation ot
an advisory -report is not the major part of the activity of the COIIIIIIi.ssionin any particular case, such reports, because of their wide distribution, bulk large in the minds of the public. Generally speaJdng, an advisory report is prepared only in connec- tion with a proceeding involving significant problems and a relatively large COJIJP8PY in which the investing public bas a substantial interest. Ap~tely twenty fonual advisory reports aDd several supplemental reports have been tiled.

The .Actrequires~ amongother things~ disclosure of the finances and of the investment policies of these companies~ to aftord investors fUll and complete information with respect to their activities; prohibits such companies from changing the nature of their business guilty of or security their investment frauds :from policies serving without as ofticers the approval and directors of the of stockholders; such companies; bars prevents persons
underwriters~ investment banlrers~ and brokers .from constituting more than a minority of the directors of such companies; requires managementcontracts in the first instances to be sub- mitted to security holders tor their approval; prohibits transactions between such companies and their officers and directors and other insiders except on the approval of the Commission; forbids the issuance of senior securities of such companies except in specified instances; and prohibits pyramiding of such companies and cross ownership of their securities.

The so-called. .stretch-out. practice of depriving the investor pursuant to contract of ~
interest return on his entire investment during any period in which he has been in default was common. Furthermore, surrender values accrued only as of yearly anniversary dates of the certLi'icates. ),{on~ payments less than a year and interest on the last attained surrender value would not increase the surrender value above the preceding anniversary date. As a result of the variety in regulatory provisions, of the many states in whi.ch face-amount cOlllp8Diesoperate, there was no uniform actuarial. reserve system required by' lair.

Commissionso as to avoid duplication; (4) the administration and enforcement of those pro- visions of the Act which regulate the relationships and transactions of persons whoare affili- ated with iIIvestmant cQDP8njes;(5) matters relating to the distribution, redemption, and re- purchases of securities issued by managementcompanies; (6) reorganizations of investment com- panies; and (7) the treatment accorded certain special types of companies, such as unit invest- ment trusts, periodic payment plans, and face-amount certificate companies.

of the Act in this connection is its use of a quantitative or statistical definition, expressed in terms of the portion of a company'sassets which are investment securities. Thusthe statute provides, inter alia, that a compa.n;y-is an "investment company"if it is engagedin the business of investing, reiIIvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities, and owns investment secu- rities (defined to exclude securities of majorit~d subsidiaries and of other investment companies) exceeding 40 percent of its total assets (exclusive of GovernmentseCUX'ities and cash items) •
However,the Act provides machinerywherebythe COIIIIIIissionmaydeclare by order upon application that a compaJ:l;T,notwithstanding the quantitative definition, is nevertheless not an investment compaIly.

Withrespect to the first - the powerto render advisory reports on request - three such requests have been received. In each case an advisory report

It was indicated to the security holders that the Commissiondid not recommendor approve the plan. Thestated purpose of the Commissionwasto assist security holders in exercising their judgmentwhether or not to accept the plan of reorganization. It was, however, the opin- ion of the Commissionthat the plan, on the basis of certain specified assumptions, was sufficiently within the lilnits of fairness to justify its submissionto the security holders for their consideration.
This function of the Commissionfills a long-felt need. It enables security holders who a often plan do of not reorganization possess great on financial their securities, knowledgeto thus obtain enabling an themto impartial arrive analysis at an of informed the effects judg-
of
mentas to the merits of the plan. It is important to note that although the Commissionhas authority to submitadvisory reports onlywhenrequested by the reorganizing
COmpanyl
s manage- ment or by 25 percent of its security holders, the existence of its powerto seek an injunction restraining a:ay grossly unfair plan of reorganization has resulted in the submission by invest- mentcompaniesof several plans for informal consideration as to fairness before solicitation of security holder approval.
Periodic Paym:;ntPlan Certificates and Unit Investment Trusts.
As already 1.nd1cated,since these periodic paymentcertificates are sold to persons of 8IIIa1l means, who frequently" default in their payments,the sales load, if it is deductedin its entirety from the early payments, will result in substantial loss to those investors whosepay- ments lapse early. in the period of the contract. TheAct deals with this problemby providing that the sales load on such certificates shall not be more than 9 percent of the total payments.

Since Januar;y 1, 1941 (the effective date of the Act for this type of investment company),the efforts of the Commissionin relation to this type of companyhave been directed mainly to the enforcement of the reserve requirements and certain related provisions of the Act pertaining to eligibility of assets, custody of assets, and certain provisions relating to cash surrender and loan values.

ExchangeAct, chiefly because the Advisers Act does not grant powerto the Commissionto in- spect books and records such as is granted under Section 17 (a) of the ExchangeAct. The absence of such powerlimits the effectiveness of the ActWith respect to protection of in- vestors. TheComnissioncannot, for instance, makeperiodic inspections to determine whether advisers whoclaim in their applications that they do not accept clients' funds for invest- mentor securities for safekeeping have truthfully reported the nature of their activities. Neither can the Commissionmakeperiodic examinations to determine whether those advisers who admit that they do accept custody of clients' funds or securities keep such property intact. This anission leaves unsupervised andunprotected a broad field in the handling of investment f'unds of the general ing summariesof two public. of the Commission'sinvestigations.
Theseriousness of the situation 21
is illustrated by the follow-
(1) Albert E. Atkinson. In September1941, a memberof the COllIIlission'sstaff attempted several times to makea routine inspection of the books of Atkinson, whowasregistered with the Commissionboth as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and as a broker-dealer under the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934. Eachtime he was unsuccessful because of Atkinson's absence. Whenfinally interviewed, Atkinson stated that he conducted only an investIll8nt advisory business; that he had but five or six clients, each of 1'Ihompaid him an annual fee of $5,000; that he did not have custody of customers' securities or funds; that he did not buy from or sell to the public as a dealer; andthat he maintained his broker- dealer engage that of registration in selling the securities investment only business. so advice, that it he would Furthermore, kept be no available books he stated or to records him that, ..menand except since a his if checkbook. he sole should function desire Since

THE COMMISSION'S FIRST DECADE IN THE COURTS
INTRODUCTIOB
This review of the C0mmi88ion
f
s first ten years in the courts summarizesthe CaJIIlission f
s efforts to effectuate the policies of the 1940. of 1934, !I
the Enforcemeni!of Public Utility the Holding prov1sicos COIIIpanyAct of Securities of 1935, Act aDd of 1933, the Investment the the Trust Indenture Act of securities ExchangeAct
CompanyAct of 1939 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 has been well-nigh entirely a matter of administrative procedure, with an almost complete absence of court review or court enforcement.
The greater portion of the CCIlIID1ssion's workin adm1n1stering these statutes never reaches the courts. Thus, in the administration of the 1933 and 1934 Acts,general rules, opinions and orders" interpretative opinions, and full and free cClllDlDJ11cationwith the CCIIIlJI1ssionand its staff" enable all those concerned with the issuance and marketing of securities to avoid viola- tions; while investigations, and even knowledgeof the prospect of investigation, deter as well as disclose offenses. In the adm1 nistration of the Holding COIIIpanyAct the day-to-day regula- tion of the activities of holding ccmpaniesis mamly a matter of licensing transactions which meet the standards of the Act. Indeed, most of the COIIIm1Ssion
f
s formal orders have not been challenged in the courts, either because the orders granted the relief sought by the persons whomight have been aggrieved by an adverse order, or because what would otherwise have been disputed issued. !hue, issues although were satisfactori1y the ~ about 100 petitions for

have been issued filed, morethan and appraximately 2,000 formal half orders of those under were the dis-
Acts,
missed on motion or stipulation of the parties betore decision onthe merits.
Throughthe cases in lIbich it has participated, the Camn1ssionhas obtained a basic set of precedents interpreting its statutory powers and duties. Manyof these cases have not ~
af- fected the Commission's own lrork but have also played a signif'icant part in the development of general administrative and corporate lsIr.
lENERAL RESULTS
By June 30, 1944, the Caam1ssionhad instituted S08 civil actions UDderthe Securities Act of 1933, the 5ecur11iiesExchange Act of 1934, the Public Utility Holding CompanyAct of 1935, the Investment Compan;yAct of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. These were for the mostpart actions in the federal district courts to enjo:1napparent or threatened violations 01' the Securities Act and securities ExchangeAct; the balance included district court proceedings to enforce subpoenas issued in the course of investigations under the Securities Act and the Securities ExchangeAct, applications to carry out voluntary plans of cOlllpliancewith the cor- porate at or
miscellaneous July integration 1, legal and proceedings.
simplif'ication or
provisions these of the Holding Company Act, and a small number cases, 479 were closed and 30 1I8re still pending 19.44.
During the same period, l88 legal proceedings were lnstituted against the Commission. The actions against the COJIIIIissionwere principa1.ly petitions for review in the circuit courts of 2ppeals and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbiaof Commissionorders under the Securities Act, the Securities ExchangeAct, the PUblic Utility Holding C~an,y Act, and the Investment Ccmpany Act, aDd federal district court proceed1ngs to enjoin enforcement of these Acts and subpoenas is8lled by the CCIIIIIi8sion in investigations thereunder; the rema1nder can- prl.sed non
a small numberof miscellaneous actions in state or its officers. Ofthe foregoing actions against and federal courts against the C<lllDis-
the CClIIIII1ssicm,169 were olosed and 19 were still pending at J'Uly 1, 1944.

On the contrary the disc10sure of specific "normal" procedures that have been omitted and disc10sure of supp1ementary procedures emp1oyed, together with the reason therefor, is a most practicab1e and he1pfu1 means of characterizing the scope of the audit performed by the certifying accountants.

the membershipof the American Institute of Accountants voted in favor of eliminating this "doub1e standard" in accountants' certificates and adopted the substance of the Commission's requirements.
Subsequent to the McKessonease the Commissionissued a number of decisions in which it criticized the auditing practices of particu1ar accountants. Of these more recent eases the two of outstanding significance In the Matter of Associated Gas were and Electric In the Matter Canpany. of Resources In the Resources Corporation case, International decided in 1940,
and
the Commissionfound that a representative of the certifying accountants had at ODetime enter- tained serious doubts as to the 1egitimaey of the operations of the registrant and had eamnuni- cated those doubts to the supervising partner of the accounting firm. The Camuission found that the certifying accountants faUed in the performance of their duties by not extending their were examination at fau1t to in res01ve that they these were doubts. aware TheCommissionalso of certain found that the certifying accountants
additional facts which were of IIlhterial signif- icance to investors but which were not disclosed.
The COIIIDIissionalso criticized the accountant's certificate furnished in the Resources case. The certificate exempted from its purview all but $35,000 of assets out of total stated assets of more than $9,000,000. The Commissionhe1d that such a report is not a "certificate" within the meaning of the Commission's rules. In 1939 the American Institute of Accountants adopted a similar position, stating that an accountant should not express an opinion on finan- cial statements if his exceptions or reservations are so material as to negative his opinion.
In In the Matter
of Associated Gas and Electric Companythe Comm1ssion8evere:Q- criticized the work of the certifying accOJIDtants. The Call1llissionfound in this case that the audits were inadequate in scope. Moreover, the opinions expressed in the accountants' certificate were not clear and were so qualified by exceptions and explanations as to render those opinions nugatory. As stated above, the COIIIII1ssion

of the opinion that the financial. statements filed by the registrant were principally intended to mystify, bafne, mislead and conceal. The Camnission went on to say that the audits and certificates of the accountants did nothing to prevent the accomplishment of that purpose.
Themost recent developments in the fieM of auditing have related primarily to ne1l"and serious problems that have arisen as a resu1t of the war. AJJ. concerned with auditing problems are agreed that high standards of auditing procedure must be maintained and that the progress recent1y achieved must noi!be lost. Aprincipal difficulty has been the loss most account- ing firms of trained personnel to other phases of the war effort. 'Furthermore, a similar Loss of accounting personnel by private business, frequently coupled with a large newVOlumeof war work, has meant that internal accounting and auditing controls upon which the public accountant must rely in manyrespects, have in manyinstances suffered and hence, with a smaller or less experienced staff, the public accountant mayoften be faced 'Withthe necessity of being even morepainstaking in his audit

The project has as its objective a series of compilations which would makemore readily available to federal bureaus and agencies and to the general public someof the financial in- formation filed with the CODIIIission. The project as constituted covers approximately 2,000 corporations, which is sOlll8Whatmorethan 85 percent of the companies having securities listed and registered on national securities exchanges at December31, 1943. The results of the Survey are being presented in two forms, individual industry reports and special statistical studies. The individual industry reports contain both combined and individual data for regis- trants from 1934 to 1943, inclusive.
Until 1942 most-reports of the Survey were madeavailable to the public, but during the past three years budgetary limitations and the paper shortage have made it necessary to limit di.stribution to governmentagencies engaged in furthering the war effort. Copies of all public reports, however, have been madeavailable for general use and inspection in the offices of the Commissionin Philadelphia and in the Colmllission's regional offices as well as in 540 depository libraries. Photocopies may also be obtained of all or parts of these reports at the regular rates.
In addition to 175 published reports madepublicly available, manyspecial studies have been madefor the Commissionand other government agencies, particularly in connection with various aspects of the war effort. Amongthe more important reports contained in the Survey have been studies of corporate profits and operations for the Price Adjustment Boards of the WarDepartment, Navy Department, Maritime Commission,Reoonstruction Finance Corporation, Treasury Department, and the Contract ReviewBranch of the WarProduction Board and the Treasury Department's Bureau of Internal Revenue; a special study"of the meat packing industry for the Office of Economic Stabilization; a study of remuneration for the Salary Stabilization Unit of the Treasury Depart- ment; a study of ownership and control of foreign corporations for the Office of Economic
War- fare; and a study of airframe manufacturers for the WarDepartment Army Air Corps.
As part of the Survey, the Commission's staff is presently engaged in compiling data for various government agencies covering the balance sheet data of 1,530 companies for five years, at the request of the Bureau of Budget's Inter-Agency Committeeon Financial Needs of Government Agencies.
During the year 1943, the coverage of the Survey was extended to those corporations regis- tered Survey's under studies the Securities was extended Act further or 1933which to investment file annual reports. During 1944, the scope of the
companies registered with the COIIIllission unde~ the Investment CompanyAct of 1940.
C!pital Market Statistics
During the past ten years the staff or the Commissionhas developed a considerable body of statistical information on the capital market. Sameof these statistics have been camnented upa:1elsewhere in the text and summarizedin Tables 1 to 4 of the Appendix, namely data on cost of notation of securities, on the volume of issues registered under the Securities Act of 1933, and on all newissues or securities offered for cash sale in the United States, inclUding issues not registered lfith the Cotmnission. In addition, studies have been madeof the extent to which actual sales of issues of securities have varied from the amounts registered for sale. Also data have been gathered on retirements or securities, which together with the stat.istics on new issues, have provided estimates of changes in the volume of securities outstanding and in the amount or saving by individuals directly in the form of securities. In cooperation with other public performance
and private or
corporate agencies, bonds.
